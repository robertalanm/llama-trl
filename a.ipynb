       "['With Donald Trump calling on Hillary Clinton to take a drug test before their third debate Wednesday evening, it’s the perfect time to bring up one of the biggest campaign issues that major news organizations have avoided: His long, deep, and strange involvement with a major cocaine and marijuana trafficker.\\n\\nTrump presents himself as the most ardent law-and-order politician ever. Yet throughout his adult life Trump sought out—and worked closely with—more than a score of criminals, including Mafia associates, Russian mob associates, violent felons, con artists, swindlers, and most significant of all, the embezzler and mob associate Joseph Weichselbaum, a thrice-convicted felon.\\n\\nLong ago, when Trump was the big man in Atlantic City, he got his helicopters to bring his high-rollers in and out of town through a company formed by Weichselbaum, to whom he also entrusted maintenance of the Ivana, Trump’s personal helicopter. Spy, a satirical magazine that often made fun of Trump, reported that Weichselbaum—at that point a twice-convicted felon—personally piloted the Trumps in that copter.\\n\\nWeichselbaum also had another business: importing drugs from Colombia and shipping them from Bradford Motors, a Miami-area car dealership he partly owned, to Cincinnati.\\n\\nWhen Weichselbaum got caught, his case was handled in a most unusual way, with both Donald Trump and one of his siblings in starring roles.\\n\\nThis relationship between the Republican presidential nominee and a major drug trafficker, revealed in court filings and other public documents, has never been explained by the candidate. Trump should be asked in every venue right up to Election Day for a complete and detailed accounting of this relationship.\\n\\nTrump’s loud sniffling through the first two debates prompted all sorts of speculation. His lagging performance at the end of the first debate, when he lost focus and went off on yet another attack on comedian Rosie O’Donnell, further fueled that speculation. Former Vermont governor and prominent Democrat Howard Dean suggested that Trump snorted cocaine ahead of the first debate, an especially fraught diagnosis even for a physician.\\n\\nThe candidate says that he does not drink or use drugs and never has. I have no evidence to the contrary.\\n\\nDean’s rank speculation, and the questions raised on social media about Trump’s sniffling in the second debate, might have been the end of the issue except that Trump decided to breathe new life into it. At campaign rallies Trump said that it seemed to him that Clinton was the one on drugs. Trump declared, against the visible evidence, that Clinton was the one exhausted by debating, suggesting this was because the effects of drugs had worn off.\\n\\nTrump is well known for projecting—taking things that apply to himself and saying that they apply to others. His comments about Clinton, who was alert and stood with good posture through both debates, did not help him.\\n\\nBut any questions about his personal drug use are small potatoes compared to his long, deep embrace of Weichselbaum. Trump risked his lucrative casino license to demonstrate his unflagging loyalty to a convicted drug trafficker.\\n\\nThe unusual relationship between Trump and Weichselbaum deserves at least as much attention as the Republican nominee’s refusal to make public any of his tax returns or the questions about what was contained in the Democratic nominee’s tens of thousands of emails that she says were private and that State Department staff deleted.\\n\\nYet, to use Trumpian language, I alone am raising the issue of his drug-distributor pal.\\n\\nLaw enforcement reports long ago identified Weichselbaum as a Mafia associate. At one time he was actively involved in cigarette-boat racing in Miami, a sport that attracted a number of high-level criminals ranging from fellow drug traffickers to corrupt financiers like Charles Keating, the poster boy for the savings-and-loan scandals of quarter century ago, who came in second in a race where Weichselbaum ran third.\\n\\nTrump needed helicopters to fly high-rollers to Atlantic City. The selection of Damin Aviation was odd given that there were better-financed helicopter companies with longer track records. Damin was set up as a lightly financed tax-sheltered operation that benefited from lavish state of New Jersey subsidies\\n\\nSummarize the preceding context in 6 sentences.

       " 'AP deletes Clinton tweet from two weeks ago\\n\\nDemocratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton (Photo: Brendan Smialowski, AFP/Getty Images)\\n\\nThe Associated Press on Thursday deleted a tweet posted two weeks earlier regarding a review the news organization had conducted of meetings Hillary Clinton held with individuals from the private sector while secretary of State.\\n\\nThe original tweet, posted on Aug. 23, read: \"BREAKING: AP analysis: More than half those who met Clinton as Cabinet secretary gave money to Clinton Foundation.\"\\n\\nIn its place, the AP tweeted Thursday: \"AP review: Many of the discretionary meetings Clinton had at State were with people who gave to Clinton Foundation.\" The tweet included a link to the August story.\\n\\nAP review: Many of the discretionary meetings Clinton had at State were with people who gave to Clinton Foundation. https://t.co/ih6Oitgou2 — The Associated Press (@AP) September 8, 2016\\n\\nIn a memo explaining the decision, John Daniszewski, vice president for standards for AP, wrote the original tweet \"fell short of AP standards by omitting essential context.\"\\n\\nThe story in question detailed how, among the individuals Clinton met with at the State Department who were outside of government, \"an extraordinary proportion\" had donated to her family\\'s foundation personally or by way of some other entity — a finding, the AP wrote, that indicated \"her possible ethics challenges if elected president.\"\\n\\nSpecifically, the AP review found that 85 of the 154 people who\\'d had in-person or phone meetings scheduled with Clinton and who weren\\'t government officials were also foundation contributors, according to the State Department calendars that were available.\\n\\nHowever, Daniszewski wrote Thursday, the tweet promoting the article \"omitted the important distinction between discretionary meetings and official meetings.\"\\n\\nIn other words, the now-deleted tweet gave the impression that a far higher percentage of Clinton\\'s total meetings while secretary were with donors than was concluded by the story\\'s analysis, given that the 154 people included in the review did not encompass the many government officials she was interacting with during her tenure, meetings that Daniszewski wrote \"made up the bulk of her workday.\"\\n\\nClinton and her campaign blasted the story not long after it was published. Speaking with CNN\\'s Anderson Cooper last month, the Democratic presidential nominee said of the growing controversy regarding the relationship between the State Department under her leadership and the Clinton Foundation: \"I know there is a lot of smoke and there is no fire.\"\\n\\nOf the AP report, Clinton said: \"It draws a conclusion and makes a suggestion that my meetings with people like the late, great Elie Wiesel or Melinda Gates or the Nobel Prize winner Muhammad Yunus were somehow due to connections with the foundation instead of their status as highly respected global leaders.\"\\n\\nClinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon said the AP \"cherry-picked a limited subset of Secretary\\'s Clinton\\'s schedule to give a distorted portrayal of how often she crossed paths with individuals connected to charitable donations to the Clinton Foundation.\"\\n\\nThe AP review included only the portion of Clinton\\'s daily schedules it had acquired following a Freedom of Information Act request. Last week, the State Department said it would produce the remainder of Clinton\\'s schedules by Oct. 17 after having previously said they would not be released until December, weeks after the election.\\n\\nThe AP memo explaining the decision regarding the Clinton tweet also addressed the organization\\'s new policy regarding the deletion of tweets, a practice it said was formally left to \"AP news managers to decide on a case-by-case basis\\n\\nSummarize the preceding context in 8 sentences.

Such a band structure leads to exceptionally\\nhigh mobility of charged carriers.\\nA question of possible mechanisms that would allow us to throttle the mobility\\nand, consequently, to control a conductivity is\\na topical subject in graphene physics,\\ndue to its fundamental as well as technological significance.\\n\\nAmong various mechanisms that might affect the mobility, the scattering that could be\\ninduced by a ripple (see, for example, discussion in Ref.\\\\onlinecite{kg}) appears\\nto be the most natural one, since graphene sheets\\nare not perfectly flat. Moreover, periodic ripples can be created and controlled\\nin suspended graphene, in particular, by thermal treatment \\\\cite{lau} and\\nby placing graphene in a especially prepared substrate.\\nIndeed, curvature of the surface affects the $ \\\\pi $ orbitals that\\ndetermine the electronic properties of graphene. It results in\\nenhancement of spin-orbit coupling that could serve as a source of spin\\nscattering.\\nWe recall  that the intrinsic (intraatomic) spin-orbit interaction in  flat graphene\\nis weak \\\\cite{min,1,2}.\\nIt makes  spin decoherence in such a material \\nweak as well, i.e., scattering due to disorder is supposed to be unimportant.\\nIn order to get deep insight into the nature of  curvature induced scattering,\\nit is desirable to elucidate among many questions the basic one: What are\\nthe distinctive features of  curvature induced spin-orbit coupling ?\\nOne can further ask\\nhow to employ these features to\\nguide an electron transport in a graphene-based system at the theoretical, and, \\nquite likely, practical levels.\\n\\nA consistent approach to introduce the curvature induced spin-orbit coupling (SOC)\\nin the low energy physics of graphene have been developed by Ando \\\\cite{Ando} and by others\\n\\\\cite{Ent,Mart,Brat} in the framework of effective mass and tight-binding\\napproximations.\\nRecent measurements in ultra clean carbon nanotubes (CNTs) \\\\cite{Ku}, i.e.,\\nin an extreme form of  curved graphene,\\nrevealed the energy splitting that\\ncan be associated with  spin-orbit coupling.\\nThe measured shifts are compatible with theoretical\\npredictions \\\\cite{Ando,Brat},  while some features\\nregarding the contribution of different spin-orbit terms in metallic and\\nnon-metallic CNTs are still debatable\\n(see, for example, discussion in \\\\cite{Loss,Chico,Jeo,izum,val,kl}).\\nNowadays, nevertheless, there is a consensus that for armchair CNTs\\none obtains two SOC terms: one preserves the spin symmetry\\n(a spin projection on the CNT symmetry axis),\\nwhile the second one breaks this symmetry\\n\\\\cite{Ando,izum,val,at1}\\n\\nSummarize the preceding context in 7 sentences.

They appear as elongated absorption features\\non the solar disk in $H_{\\\\alpha}$ and some extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lines \\\\citep{anz05}. Outside the solar disk, they appear as emitting plasma structures\\ncalled ``prominences\". Filaments are usually formed above the polarity inversion lines (PILs),\\nwhich separate positive and negative magnetic flux regions in the photosphere \\\\citep{mar98}. It has become a consensus that magnetic field supports\\nthe cold and dense plasma of filaments against gravity in the corona. Despite over a century of increasingly detailed observations and studies,\\nthe mechanism accounting for the filament formation is still controversial. Unravelling the mechanism of filament formation\\nrequires a thorough understanding of the formation of the magnetic structure and the cool dense plasma of filaments.\\n\\n\\nAs stressed by \\\\citet{chen20a} that a filament should be a coronal structure. Many direct measurements of prominence magnetic fields\\nhave shed some light on the magnetic structure of prominences \\\\citep{ler89,oro14,schm14}.\\nHowever, it is difficult to determine prominence magnetic fields due to the ambiguity of Stokes inversion or the coronal magnetic fields surrounding the prominences.\\nThe detailed magnetic structure of filaments is still far from being fully understood. Nevertheless,\\nprevious theoretical and observational studies on filaments have deepened our understanding of the magnetic structure of filaments.\\nSheared arcades \\\\citep{ks57,dev00} and flux ropes \\\\citep{kr74,van89} are believed to be suitable for supporting filaments.\\nA flux rope naturally contains magnetic dips above the PILs, and the cool dense plasma of the filaments is preferentially supported in the dips.\\nA sheared arcade can contain or not contain magnetic dips. Considering a filament is a dynamic entity, \\\\citet{kar01}\\nsuggested that filaments can even be supported by sheared arcades without magnetic dips. Both sheared arcades and flux ropes\\ncan be formed by the surface mechanisms or the subsurface mechanisms \\\\citep[see the review by][]{mac10}.\\nIn the surface mechanisms \\\\citep{van89,mar01}, magnetic reconnection occurs between a series of magnetic arcades\\nstraddling the PILs to form the sheared arcades or flux ropes, under the joint of photospheric shear flows parallel to the PILs and converging flows perpendicular to the PILs\\n\\nSummarize the preceding context in 7 sentences.

       " '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\\section{Introduction}\\n\\n\\nEven though the formulation of quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is known since half a century ago, the first-principles determination of its low energy interactions remains a mystery. The strong interaction grows as the energies involved become smaller. This prevents us from using perturbation theory techniques. Actually, at low energies, the chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken. Quarks are confined into hadrons at the 1 GeV scale. As a result, the well-known pseudo-Goldstone boson octet emerges, of which pions and kaons are the two lightest particles. Not surprisingly, the study of these meson-meson interactions is crucial for testing our understanding of the QCD chiral symmetry breaking pattern. Furthermore, light mesons appear in the final states of most hadronic interactions in experiments, which makes the understanding of their scattering processes necessary. On top of that, there exists a myriad of mesons that appear as resonances in these low-energy meson-meson scattering channels. For example, this is the case of the $\\\\sigma/f_0(500)$ and $\\\\kappa/K^*_0(700)$ resonances. These have been subject to fierce debate for many decades~\\\\cite{Pelaez:2015qba}, they do not fit in the ordinary $q \\\\bar q$ picture, and could probably exhibit more exotic structures~\\\\cite{Esposito:2016noz,Guo:2017jvc}.\\n\\n\\nUnfortunately, mesons are short-lived. They decay through electroweak processes. This renders their direct experimental detection very challenging, as no two-meson beam experiment could be realistically run. We rely on indirect measurements instead, of which there exist several $\\\\pi K$ scattering experiments  \\\\cite{Bakker:1970wg, Cho:1969qk,Linglin:1973ci, Estabrooks:1977xe, Aston:1987ir} and the recent KLF proposal~\\\\cite{KLF:2020gai}. All the main data sets are obtained by studying meson-nucleon to meson-meson-nucleon interactions. The desired pion-meson scattering is then obtained by assuming one pion exchange dominance, which in practice introduces a source of systematic uncertainty. This could produce a large systematic effect depending on the precision and energy range for the determination of the transferred momentum. As a result, the literature is plagued with many conflicting data sets (see \\\\cite{Pelaez:2015qba, Pelaez:2020gnd, Pelaez:2021dak}). Unfortunately, some of the $\\\\pi K$ scattering measurements seem to be largely affected by these.\\n\\n\\nThe determination of their low-energy interactions is crucial to testing our knowledge of QCD in the non-perturbative regime. The effective field theory describing meson interactions, Chiral Perturbation Theory (ChPT), is known for many decades now. Pions, kaons, and etas form what is known as the $SU(3)$ pseudoscalar meson octet\\n\\nSummarize the preceding context in 6 sentences.

       " '\\\\section{Introduction}\\\\label{intro}\\n\\n\\\\noindent\\\\P\\\\quad This paper is peculiar in more aspects than one. \\nHere are some indications as to\\nwhat this paper is and does, and what it is not and does not.\\n\\n\\\\begin{itemize}\\n\\\\item This paper is an attempt at a careful critical\\n\\treading of Einstein\\'s paper on the special theory of relativity\\n\\t\\\\cite{einstein-special}. In particular, we rigorously examine the physical\\n\\tprocedures required to establish an appropriate correspondence between\\n\\tspace- and time-measuring devices in two reference frames moving uniformly\\n\\tand rectilinearly relative to each other; we refer to such physical\\n\\tprocedures as adjustment of reference frames.  \\n\\\\item As such, this paper is most definitely not in the mainstream.  To the best\\n\\tof my knowledge, it \\n\\tbears little relation with any work which has followed Einstein\\'s \\n\\t\\\\cite{einstein-special}. Therefore, ``reading\" this paper by way of\\n\\tassociations with existing literature will most probably result in\\n\\tmisunderstanding. \\n\\\\item This paper is entirely self-contained, except for the purely\\n\\tmathematical references \\\\cite{alexandrov,fund-th,bor-heger}.\\n\\\\item In no way does this paper use the notion of the metric tensor or any \\n\\tterms\\n\\tbased on that notion. The consideration is local throughout the paper,\\n\\texcept for Section \\\\ref{waves}, where a condition of differentiability \\n\\tin an\\n\\tentire region of spacetime is imposed. Therefore, an attempt to interpret \\n\\tthe results of this\\n\\tpaper in \\n\\tmetric-based terms will most probably lead to misunderstanding. \\n\\\\item Neither any properties of electromagnetic waves nor even their\\n\\texistence are used in this paper. \\n\\\\item Thus, in the usual sense, the theories presented here pertain neither to\\n\\tthe ``special\" theory of relativity (since we do not unilize the notion of\\n\\tlight) nor to the ``general\" one (since we do not unilize the notion of\\n\\tthe metric).\\n\\\\item No specific properties such as inertiality, group properties, properties\\n\\tof specific measuring devices as rigid or elastic bodies are used.  \\n\\\\item No properties of spacetime such as isotropy and reciprocity are fixed\\n\\tthroughout this paper. Rather, an entire spectrum of possible physical \\n\\tscenarios is considered, ranging from scenarios with no assumptions\\n\\twhatsoever on isotropy or reciprocity to ones where both isotropy and\\n\\treciprocity are assumed to be fully present. \\n\\\\item In each such scenario, it is shown that there exists an adjustment of \\n\\tthe pair\\n\\tof reference frames in question which makes the pair Lorentzian; the\\n\\t``amount\" of the required adjustment is the less the more isotropy or\\n\\treciprocity is there.\\n\\\\item The treatment is completely rigorous, which is convenient and almost\\nunavoidable for a careful logical examination and especially when dealing\\n\\twith the multitude of the possible scenarios. \\n\\tYet, the mathematics involved is most elementary, even though at times\\n\\ttedious.\\n\\\\item One should note that the notion of reference frames (RFs) and that of \\n\\tRF change \\n\\ttransformations (RFCTs) are defined in this paper to allow the most general\\n\\tconsideration: namely, so that {\\\\em any} non-singular $4\\\\times4$ real \\n\\tmatrix is a matrix\\n\\tof some RFCT.\\n\\\\end{itemize}\\nSince the first days of the theory of relativity, the common belief has been \\nthat the Lorentzian transformations can appear only as a consequence of special \\nphysical conditions, which the RFs under consideration must satisfy, such as \\ninertiality, constancy (in various senses) of the speed of light, isotropy, \\nreciprocity, the principle of relativity, properties of rigid or elastic \\nbodies, various group conditions, etc.\\n\\nQuite contrary to this belief,\\nwe demonstrate in this paper that the Lorentzian transformations can arise \\nsimply \\nas the result of an appropriate (possibly anisotropic) rescaling and \\nre-synchronization \\nof {\\\\em any} given pair of mutually uniformly and rectilinearly moving \\n(URMoving) RFs.\\n\\nThis is the first main result of this paper, Theorem \\\\ref{TH1-cor}, \\npage \\\\pageref{TH1-cor},\\nstated also in the first sentence of the above Abstract\\n\\nSummarize the preceding context in 8 sentences.

Together with measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background\\n(CMB) radiation and gravitational lensing the redshift surveys provide\\nmajor probes of the world's geometry and the dark matter.\\n\\n\\nIn spite of the rapid progress\\ntwo gaps remain in our understanding of \\nthe density fluctuations as a function of scale:\\n(i) It is still unclear how to relate the distributions of \\n    galaxies and mass;  \\n(ii) Little is known about fluctuations \\non  intermediate scales \\nbetween these of local galaxy surveys ($\\\\sim 100 h^{-1} $ Mpc)\\nand the scales probed by COBE ($\\\\sim 1000 h^{-1} $ Mpc). \\n\\nAnother related but unresolved issue is the value of the density parameter\\n$\\\\Omega$.  Putting together different cosmological observations, the\\nderived values seem to be inconsistent with each other.  \\nTaking into account moderate\\nbiasing, the redshift and peculiar velocity data on large scales yield\\n$\\\\Omega \\\\approx 0.3 -1.5$, with a trend towards the popular \\nvalue $\\\\sim 1$\\n(e.g. Dekel 1994; Strauss \\\\& Willick 1995 for summary of results).\\nOn the other hand, the high fraction of baryons in clusters, combined\\nwith the baryon density from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis suggests $\\\\Omega\\n\\\\approx 0.2$ (White et al. 1993).  Moreover, an $\\\\Omega=1$ universe is\\nalso in conflict with a high value of the\\nHubble constant ($H_0 \\\\approx 70-80$ km/sec/Mpc),\\nas in this model the universe turns out to be younger\\nthan globular clusters.

However, the  lower limit   where the  QCD-like chirally broken and confining phase turns conformal requires  a non-perturbative approach. \\n The conformal phase is characterized by an infrared fixed point (IRFP) where the gauge coupling is irrelevant.  In the ``walking technicolor\" scenario the  conformal window opens up when the  renormalization group (RG) $\\\\beta$ function vanishes just before chiral symmetry breaking could decouple the fermions \\\\cite{Miransky:1998dh,Appelquist:1997fp,Appelquist:2010gy,Golterman:2016lsd,Golterman:2018mfm}. This fixed point turns into an IRFP as the number of fermions is further increased, but at the sill the $\\\\beta$ function has a maximum that just touches zero.     Alternatively, the IRFP could appear together with an ultraviolet fixed point (UVFP)  as hypothesized by several authors \\\\cite{Kaplan:2009kr,Gorbenko:2018ncu,Pomarol:2019aae}.  At the sill of the conformal window the $\\\\beta$ function is similar to that of the walking scenario. The difference becomes evident in the conformal regime where the $\\\\beta$ function exhibits both an IRFP and a UVFP. Conformality is \"lost\" as the two fixed points merge and move into the complex plane. This latter scenario is particularly interesting as the emergence of a  UVFP implies a second order phase transition with a new relevant operator.   The corresponding phase diagram   of  the conformal regime  was sketched in Ref.\\\\cite{Hasenfratz:2019puu} and reproduced in the left panel of Fig.\\\\ref{fig:phasediag}. The sketch shows the  phase structure and the RG flows in an extended parameter space that includes a new relevant operator denoted by $G$. As the number of flavors increases the IRFP moves to weaker coupling. When the Gaussian FP (GFP) and the IRFP merge, the system becomes infrared free. On the other hand, when the number of flavors decreases, the IRFP approaches the UVFP.  The opening of the conformal window is characterized by the merge of the UV and IR fixed points, as is sketched on the right panel of Fig.\\\\ref{fig:phasediag}. \\n\\n\\\\begin{figure*}[tbh]\\n\\\\vspace{-19mm}\\n\\\\includegraphics[width=0.99\\\\columnwidth]{Plots/RG_flow_conformal.pdf} \\n\\\\includegraphics[width=0.99\\\\columnwidth]{Plots/RG_flow_sill.pdf} \\n\\\\vspace{-7mm}\\n\\\\floatcaption{fig:phasediag}\\n{\\nSketch of a hypothetical phase diagram  of a conformal system with concomitant infrared and ultraviolet fixed points in an extended parameter space\\n\\nSummarize the preceding context in 8 sentences.

       " \"\\\\section{Background on Pareto distribution and parameter estimation}\\\\label{s:pareto}\\nA Pareto-distributed random variable $X$ with minimum value $x_{\\\\text{min}}>0$ and tail exponent $\\\\alpha>0$ is described by its complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) $\\\\bar{F}(x)$\\n\\\\begin{align}\\n\\\\bar{F}(x)=\\\\mathbb{P}(X> x)=\\\\Bigl(\\\\frac{x}{x_{\\\\text{min}}}\\\\Bigr)^{-\\\\alpha},\\\\,x\\\\ge x_{\\\\text{min}}.\\n\\\\end{align}\\nThe expected value of $X$ is equal to $(\\\\alphax_{\\\\text{min}})/(\\\\alpha-1)$ if $\\\\alpha>1$, and $\\\\infty$ otherwise.\\n\\nIn order to analyze the power law behavior of city and blackout sizes, we use the PLFIT\\nmethod introduced in~\\\\cite{Clauset2009} to fit a Pareto distribution to a given empirical dataset $\\\\{x_i\\\\}_{i=1}^N$.\\nThe PLFIT method is based on a combination of the Hill estimator to find the\\ntail exponent $\\\\alpha$, and on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic to find $x_{\\\\text{min}}$, as outlined below.\\nFor each possible choice of $x_{\\\\text{min}}$, the best-fitting tail index $\\\\alpha$ is found via the Hill estimator~\\\\cite{hill1975}\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\hat{\\\\alpha}(x_{\\\\text{min}})=n\\\\Bigl[\\\\sum_{x_i\\\\ge x_{\\\\text{min}}} \\\\ln \\\\frac{x_i}{x_{\\\\text{min}}}\\\\Bigr]^{-1}.\\n\\\\] Then, the KS goodness-of-fit statistic $D(x_{\\\\text{min}}) = \\\\max_{x\\\\gex_{\\\\text{min}}} |S(x) - P(x)|$ is calculated, where $S(x)$ is the empirical Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of the data and $P(x)$ is the CDF of the Pareto distribution with parameters $x_{\\\\text{min}}$ and $\\\\hat{\\\\alpha}(x_{\\\\text{min}})$. Finally, the estimated $\\\\hat{x}_{\\\\text{min}}$ is the one that minimizes $D$ over all possible choices of $x_{\\\\text{min}}$.\\nUncertainty in the estimated tail exponent $\\\\hat{\\\\alpha}(\\\\hat{x}_{\\\\text{min}})$ and lower bound $\\\\hat{x}_{\\\\text{min}}$ is quantified via the nonparametric bootstrap method described in~\\\\cite{Clauset2009}.\\nFinally, a goodness-of-fit test based on the KS statistic is used to generate a p-value that quantifies the plausibility of the power law hypothesis.\\nThe authors in~\\\\cite{Clauset2009} suggest to use the following (conservative) choice: the power law is \\\\textit{ruled out} if $p \\\\le 0.1$.\\n\\nWe remark that any automatic procedure for the estimation of the parameter $x_{\\\\text{min}}$ is imperfect and should be paired with additional, case-by-case analysis. For instance, it is not known whether the PLFIT estimator is consistent.\\nIn this paper, we always couple the PLFIT procedure with the manual observations of the Hill plot, i.e. the graph of the mapping $x_{\\\\text{min}}\\\\to\\\\hat{\\\\alpha}(x_{\\\\text{min}})$, and report whether the PLFIT results are consistent with the visual analysis of this plot, i.e. whether $\\\\hat{x}_{\\\\text{min}}$ lies within a region where the values of $\\\\alpha$ are relatively stable.\\n\\n\\n\\\\section{Historical data analysis}\\n\\nIn this section, we analyze the scale-free behavior of US city and blackouts sizes.\\nThe data for US city sizes, as per the 2000 US census, are available in~\\\\cite{Clauset2009}. The data for US blackouts are extracted from the Electric Disturbance Events Annual Summaries, Form OE-417~\\\\cite{OE417} of the US Department of Energy, which includes information on the date, area of interest and number of customers affected by outage events. Here, the size of a blackout is defined as the number of customers affected by it. The dataset covers the period 2002-2018.\\n\\nEach record, or row, of the OE-417 dataset, contains information such as the date, area of interest and the number of customers affected in a single outage event.\\nThe presence of missing or noisy records in the dataset\\nrequires the following pre-processing actions: i) records for which the ``Number of customers affected'' entry is unknown are removed; ii) records for which the ``Number of customers affected'' consists of two or more values, corresponding to different US states, are modified by replacing the multiple values with their sum; iii) records for which the ``Number of customers affected'' entry is not purely numeric are removed. The only two exceptions to iii) are when \\\\textit{both} the “cumulative” and “peak” number of customers affected are reported (in which case only the “cumulative” values is retained), and when the number of customers affected is described by a range of values (in which case the midpoint value is retained).\\n\\nTable~\\\\ref{tab:PLFIT_stats} reports the PLFIT estimated parameters, the corresponding standard deviations (calculated using the nonparametric bootstrap method in~\\\\cite{Clauset2009}), as well as the KS p-values, which indicate a good fit\\n\\nSummarize the preceding context in 8 sentences.

       " \"\\\\section{Introduction}\\n\\\\vspace*{-1mm}\\n\\\\IEEEPARstart{V}{isible} light communication (VLC) has attracted significant research interest and is expected to be a key component of future communication systems \\\\cite{8669813}. VLC, a communication technology that uses frequencies in the visible light spectrum, offers a vast amount of license-free bandwidth, high security due to the poor penetration of visible light signals, and relatively lower power consumption since the same power is used for the dual-purpose of illumination and communication. VLC uses readily available light sources such as light emitting diodes (LEDs) as transmitters and the receivers are equipped with photodetectors (PDs). Data transmission is achieved in VLC systems via intensity modulation at the transmitter side and direct detection at the receiver side.  \\n\\nLike other high-frequency communication technologies (e.g., terahertz and millimeter-wave), signal propagation at such frequencies is short-range and highly susceptible to blockages. Hence, successful signal transmission in VLC requires a direct line-of-sight (LoS) path between the transmitter and the receiver. The inherent characteristics of visible light signals promote a mutually beneficial co-existence of VLC and radio frequency (RF) communication systems. More particularly, RF communication systems cannot support the ongoing rapid increase in demand for capacity due to the limited available radio spectrum in the sub-6 GHz band and the rising costs of installation and maintenance of RF cell sites. Hence, the co-existence of VLC and RF communication systems allows the combination of the former's high-speed data transmission and the latter's ubiquitous connectivity. It also provides a promising solution to the potential connectivity issues (resulting from blockages and users being in dead zones) in VLC.\\n\\nThe design of communication systems that allow the co-existence of VLC and RF systems can be realized in two main ways, namely, hybrid RF/VLC systems \\\\cite{7593453,8013858,8949364,9484068,8966290,9159585,9411734,9578932,6965999,6655152,9148909,8110682,8741202,8395016,9667214,8862946,8970349} and aggregated RF/VLC systems \\\\cite{7417378,7437374,7293077,7402263,9149834,9614989,8314706,8926487}. The former realizes signal transmission to any user via a VLC or an RF link, while the latter utilizes both VLC and RF links simultaneously to serve any user. However, the challenging problems of access point (AP) assignment due to the mixture of heterogeneous APs and the efficient allocation of transmit power and bandwidth resources arise in such communication systems \\\\cite{8669813,8013858,9411734}. \\nSpecifically, the APs and receivers in VLC systems have limited field-of-view (FoV), affecting the strength of any received signal. As a result, the closest  AP might no longer provide the strongest channel gain \\\\cite{9121765}\\n\\nSummarize the preceding context in 5 sentences.

       " '\\\\section{INTRODUCTION}\\n\\n\\\\IEEEPARstart{U}{ltra}-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) is one of fifth generation (5G) driven use cases, for which the third partnership project (3GPP) and the International Mobile Telecommunications 2020 and beyond (IMT-2020) specified stringent latency and reliability requirements to fulfill. The 3GPP Rel. 14 has defined these requirements to at most 1 ms latency with an outage probability of less than $10^{-5}$ for a 32 byte packet \\\\cite{rel14,Pacovi2018}. In fact, the set of URLLC services with these demanding requirements in the real world, is inappropriate with the best effort manner of long term evolution (LTE) \\\\cite{strodthoff}. To this end, the 5G New Radio (NR) has been standardized with a set of specifications in Rel. 15, which incorporates basic URLLC features. Indeed, the NR covers implicitly the air interface latency aspect by the considered 5G numerology, however, it is not developed enough to fully achieve the required latencies. In fact, still the retransmission process across the air-interface unclear, in particular, the hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) roundtrip time (RTT) which has to be shortened to fit in the assumed 1 ms latency budget. Otherwise, the contribution of HARQ to URLLC is too critical and might be then, limited \\\\cite{srveyURLLC}. However, recently, as part of Rel. 16, different areas of improvements have been specified for the NR URLLC foundation. One of these enhancements focused on the uplink control information (UCI), eventually, the HARQ feedback. In fact, the main purpose is to enable the NR support for applications with latency requirements in the range of 0.5 to 1 ms and where network reliability is critical \\\\cite{rel16_stg2}. Along with this, other technological capabilities have been included to enable real-time situations, namely, the sidelink concept specifically for cellular-vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) communications and integrated access backhaul (IAB) that points out mainly the relay concept upon 3GPP NR. Yet, several extensions will be supported by a Rel. 17 work item in order to bring several  IAB improvements in terms of spectral efficiency (SE), latency, and performance. In other words Rel. 17 will rejuvenate the interest toward full-duplex (FD) transmission mode by proposing a multiplexing option for transmissions between the backhaul and access links, referred as, IAB-node full-duplex \\\\cite{rel17}.  These changes mark undeniably the dawn of 6G era toward which the rich theory of FD cooperative communications is getting unleashed to aid the full sustainability of the next generation driving use cases with stringent requirements in terms of latency and reliability \\\\cite{rel16_2}. \\n\\nCooperative relaying and FD radio communication have been extensively identified as a promising network technology to improve wireless communications reliability. In other words, as the capacity improvement is promoted by the SE improvement, the adoption of FD communication at the relay node is more advantageous and efficient. Meanwhile, thanks to recent advances noted in antenna technology and signal processing techniques, it is practical to use the FD communication mode on cooperative relaying systems even with the presence of a significant loop interference \\\\cite{rsiCancel1,FDcancel,FD2}. Furthermore, in the perspective of a low latency, FD relaying mode allows fast device-to-device discovery, and hence, contributes on the delay reduction. Accordingly, all these practical growth have  incited authors to adopt FD communications in their researches, thus, get rid of the spectral inefficiency caused by half-duplex (HD) relaying mode \\\\cite{FD1,c3}.\\n\\nLikewise, cooperative relay communications have been always the focus of several works in the literature. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge their full-fledged implementation has never occurred\\n\\nSummarize the preceding context in 8 sentences.

       " \"Untitled , John Stezaker\\n\\nOn Saturday evening September 17, 1977, Leslie Munn went drinking with friends in Manor Park, east London, and never came back.\\n\\nJust before midnight, Leslie was seen leaving The Star pub on Snowshill Road. A little while after, he was found sprawled in the middle of Warwick Road (E12), less than half a mile from his home. He had sustained serious head injuries and was unconscious.\\n\\nLying next to Leslie on the ground was his friend, ex-paratrooper Paul Lee (22). They were lined up adjacent to Paul’s wrecked car, which had crashed into the front wall of a nearby house. What happened between the two young men leaving the pub, and being found like this, remains largely a mystery.\\n\\nLeslie was taken to East Ham Memorial Hospital and then onwards to St Bart’s teaching hospital, central London, where he was kept alive by an artificial respirator. He died the following Tuesday without regaining consciousness. By which point the police had launched a murder investigation.\\n\\nLeslie Munn was 16 years old. His death certificate has the cause of death as ‘cerebral contusions and lacerations due to compound fractured skull.’\\n\\nI knew Leslie from youth club.\\n\\nMight sound silly now, but back then youth club was actually a big deal. Every Friday night, all year round, between 50 to a 100 youths, aged from 14 to 16, would gather at a youth club in an annexe next to the local Catholic church.\\n\\nLeslie was two years older than me and had outgrown the club by the time of his death. Probably the last occasion him and his mates attended was the previous summer - on the night after their leaving day at school. I can hear the big boys that night lobbing boasts back and forth about their first proper jobs and how much they were getting paid. Leslie had landed a job as a messenger. One guy spoke of starting on £30 a week selling clothes at Mr Byrite.\\n\\nDespite being connected to the church, and with God in such close proximity, the youth club wasn't religious. Each Friday night started with the boys playing football in the playground of the primary school next door; while indoors, the girls danced to records. And then after football, the boys joined the girls upstairs, mainly to talk, dance and flirt.\\n\\nIn Boyhood Island , Book Three of Karl Ove Knausgaard’s hypnotic series of autobiographical novels, the author remembers the glittery attraction of his village youth club growing up as a teenager in 1970s rural Norway . In the years when he was too young to attend, youth club figured as a ‘mythological place’ of promise. When finally his time came, Karl Ove's debut night ‘felt as though I was being initiated into a rite of passage’. The first few Friday evenings he'd return home after youth club ‘with my head totally in a spin, normality cast under some mysterious spell… endlessly rich and alluring, full of hope and possibilities…’\\n\\nI am angry, I am ill and I'm ugly as sin\\n\\nOf course such sensations don’t endure - youth gobbles up promise as it rushes headlong towards the next big thing. But Knausgaard's wistful romantic record of past times resonates. I always remember youth club in the glow of a summer's evening; it's never winter\\n\\nSummarize the preceding context in 7 sentences.

       " '\\\\section{Introduction}\\n\\nSupersymmetric gauge theories have attracted a lot of attention because, for\\nexample, some aspects of their dynamics are accessible to analytic methods. In \\nparticular, techniques from string theory can be applied to these systems. The \\n$SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory with ${\\\\cal N}=1$ supersymmetry describes the \\ninteractions between gluons and gluinos. Here we investigate this model both at\\nzero and at non-zero temperatures. Of course, at non-zero temperatures\\nsupersymmetry is explicitly broken due to different boundary conditions for \\ngluons and gluinos in the Euclidean time direction. This is no problem because \\nwe will use methods of effective field theory that do not rely on \\nsupersymmetry. At low temperatures, the theory is in a confined phase with a \\nspontaneously broken ${\\\\sf Z \\\\!\\\\!\\\\! Z}(N)_\\\\chi$ chiral symmetry, while at high temperatures \\none expects chiral symmetry to be restored and gluons and gluinos to be \\ndeconfined. In the deconfined phase, the ${\\\\sf Z \\\\!\\\\!\\\\! Z}(N)_c$ center symmetry of the \\n$SU(N)$ gauge group is spontaneously broken. In addition, at zero temperature \\ngluons and gluinos may exist in a non-Abelian Coulomb phase without confinement\\nor chiral symmetry breaking. The existence of the Coulomb phase is a \\ncontroversial issue. For the rest of this paper, we assume that it exists. The \\nrich phase structure gives rise to interesting effects related to the \\ninterfaces separating various bulk phases. Due to spontaneous ${\\\\sf Z \\\\!\\\\!\\\\! Z}(N)_\\\\chi$ \\nbreaking, there are $N$ distinct confined phases with different values of the \\ngluino condensate $\\\\chi^{(n)} = \\\\chi_0 \\\\exp(2 \\\\pi i n/N)$, $n \\\\in \\n\\\\{1,2,...,N\\\\}$. These phases are separated by confined-confined interfaces. \\nSimilarly, at high temperatures, ${\\\\sf Z \\\\!\\\\!\\\\! Z}(N)_c$ breaking gives rise to $N$ \\ndeconfined phases with different values of the Polyakov loop $\\\\Phi^{(n)} = \\n\\\\Phi_0 \\\\exp(2 \\\\pi i n/N)$, $n \\\\in \\\\{1,2,...,N\\\\}$, which are separated by \\ndeconfined-deconfined interfaces. Assuming a first order phase transition, at \\n$T_c$ there are, in addition, confined-deconfined interfaces. Finally, at zero \\ntemperature, the confined phases can coexist with the Coulomb phase, which has \\na vanishing gluino condensate $\\\\chi^{(0)} = 0$. Hence, there are also \\nconfined-Coulomb interfaces. \\n\\nThe properties of confined-Coulomb and confined-confined interfaces at zero \\ntemperature have been studied in detail by Shifman and collaborators \\n\\\\cite{Kov97,Kog98}. In particular, the tension of an interface separating two \\nbulk phases with gluino condensates $\\\\chi^{(m)}$ and $\\\\chi^{(n)}$ is \\nconstrained by the inequality\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\alpha_{mn} \\\\geq \\\\frac{N}{8 \\\\pi^2} |\\\\chi^{(m)} - \\\\chi^{(n)}| =\\n\\\\frac{N \\\\chi_0}{8 \\\\pi^2} |\\\\exp(2 \\\\pi i m/N) - \\\\exp(2 \\\\pi i n/N)|.\\n\\\\end{equation}\\nIf the interface represents a BPS saturated state, this inequality is satisfied\\nas an equality. Indeed, confined-Coulomb interfaces are BPS saturated\\n\\\\cite{Kog98}, such that\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\alpha_{0n} = \\\\frac{N \\\\chi_0}{8 \\\\pi^2}.\\n\\\\end{equation}\\nThe interface tensions determine the shape of a droplet of Coulomb phase that\\nwets a confined-confined domain wall. As shown in figure 1a, such a droplet\\nforms a lens with opening angle $\\\\theta$, where\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\alpha_{mn} = 2 \\\\alpha_{0n} \\\\cos{\\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}}\\n\\nSummarize the preceding context in 8 sentences.

       " \"\\n\\n\\\\section{Introduction}\\n\\nCaching content at the network edge can mitigate the heavy traffic burden at network peak times. Contents are proactively stored in caches at the Edge Nodes (ENs) or at the end-users during low-traffic periods, relieving network congestion at peak hours \\\\cite{Kangasharju-2002,Nygren-2010}. Edge caching at the ENs can enable cooperative wireles transmission in the presence of shared cached contents across multiple ENs \\\\cite{Liu-2015, Sengupta-2017, Naderializadeh-2017}. In contrast, caching of shared content at the users  enables the multicasting of coded information that is useful simultaneously for multiple users \\\\cite{MaddahAli-2014,Karamchandani-2016,Pedarsani-2016,Zhang-2017-0}.\\n\\n\\nIn practice, not all contents can be cached, and requested uncached contents should be fetched from a central server through finite-capacity fronthaul links. This more general set-up, illustrated in Fig.~1, was studied in \\\\cite{Sengupta-2017, Tandon-2016,Azimi-2017,Zhang-2017} (see also reference therein) in the absence of users' caches. These references consider as the performance metric of interest the overall delivery latency, including both fronthaul and wireless contributions. In particular, in prior works \\\\cite{Naderializadeh-2017}\\\\cite{Madda-15}, the delivery latency is measured in the high Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) regime. While \\\\cite{Sengupta-2017, Tandon-2016,Azimi-2017} allow any form of delivery strategy, including interference alignment, in \\\\cite{Zhang-2017}, the optimal high-SNR latency performance is studied under the assumption that wireless transmission can only use practical one-shot linear precoding strategies. Reference \\\\cite{Zhang-2017} presents a caching-fronthaul-wireless transmission scheme that is shown to be latency-optimal within a multiplicative factor of $3/2$.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\\begin{figure}[t!] \\n  \\\\centering\\n\\\\includegraphics[width=0.65\\\\columnwidth]{model.pdf}\\n\\\\caption{Cloud-RAN system with cache-enabled ENs and end-users.} \\n\\\\label{fig:model}\\n\\\\vspace{-1.7em}\\n\\\\end{figure}\\n\\n\\nIn this paper, we extend the results in \\\\cite{Zhang-2017} by allowing caching not only at the ENs but also at the end-users. To this end, we consider the cloud-RAN scenario in Fig.~1 and evaluate the impact of both cooperative transmission opportunities at the ENs and multicasting opportunities brought by caching at the users. Caching at the users has, in fact, two potentially beneficial effects on the network performance. First, since users have already cached some parts of the library, they need not receive from the network the cached portion of the requested file --- this is known as the \\\\emph{local caching gain}. Second, as assumed, by a careful cache content placement, a common coded message can benefit more than one user, which is known as the \\\\emph{global caching gain} \\\\cite{MaddahAli-2014}. Assuming that entire library is cached across ENs and users and that the fronthaul links are absent, reference \\\\cite{Naderializadeh-2017} proved that the gains accrued form cooperative transmission by the ENs and the global caching gain provided by users' caches are additive. Here, we generalize this conclusion by considering the role of finite-capacity fronthaul links and by allowing for partial caching of the library of popular files across ENs and users. \\n\\n\\n \\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows\\n\\nSummarize the preceding context in 7 sentences.

The distribution of processing tasks across multiple nodes can introduce complexity in terms of resource allocation, data synchronization, and load balancing. Additionally, maintaining high availability and fault tolerance becomes crucial when relying on distributed infrastructure. Another limitation may be the increased cost associated with deploying and managing additional hardware at network edges compared to traditional approaches where most processing occurs centrally within data centers. Overall, careful planning and design considerations are necessary to ensure smooth integration between these two technologies while addressing any performance trade-offs that might arise along the way\\nAnswer the question step by step and explain your thoughts.

Patient engagement has been a crucial factor in the success of Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs). By involving patients in their care through tools like patient portals, educational materials, and reminders for preventative care, ACOs foster a sense of ownership over health and wellness. This empowers patients to make informed decisions about their care, ultimately leading to better health outcomes and reduced costs by avoiding unnecessary hospital readmissions or complications.

Patient engagement has been a crucial factor in the success of Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs). By involving patients in their care through tools like patient portals, educational materials, and reminders for preventative care, ACOs foster a sense of ownership over health and wellness. This empowers patients to make informed decisions about their care, ultimately leading to better health outcomes and reduced costs by avoiding unnecessary hospital readmissions or complications. Additionally, robust communication and coordination among ACO providers further support cost reduction and improved quality by minimizing redundancies and ensuring timely interventions when needed.\\n\\nQuestion:1.

       " '\\\\section{Introduction} \\n\\nThroughout this paper, we will let $\\\\mathbb{N}$ denote the set of positive integers, and we will let $\\\\mathbb{P}=\\\\{2, 3, 5, \\\\ldots\\\\}$ denote the set of (integer) prime numbers. \\n\\\\par \\nThe arithmetic functions $\\\\sigma_k$ are defined, for every integer $k$, by  \\\\\\\\ \\n$\\\\displaystyle{\\\\sigma_k(n)=\\\\sum_{\\\\substack{c\\\\vert n\\\\\\\\c>0}}c^k}$. For each integer $k\\\\neq 0$, $\\\\sigma_k$ is multiplicative and satisfies \\\\\\\\ \\n$\\\\displaystyle{\\\\sigma_k (p^\\\\alpha)=\\\\frac{p^{k(\\\\alpha+1)}-1}{p^k-1}}$ for all (integer) primes $p$ and positive integers $\\\\alpha$. The abundancy index of a positive integer $n$ is defined by $\\\\displaystyle{I(n)=\\\\frac{\\\\sigma_1(n)}{n}}$. Some of the most interesting questions related to the abundancy index are those dealing with perfect and multiperfect numbers. \\n\\\\par\\nA positive integer $n$ is said to be $t$-perfect if $I(n)=t$ for a positive integer $t\\\\geq 2$, and $2$-perfect numbers, which have been studied since the ancient Greeks, are called perfect numbers. It is known that there is a one-to-one correspondence between even perfect numbers and Mersenne primes, so it is, therefore, unknown whether or not there are infinitely many even perfect numbers. Although no odd perfect numbers are currently known to exist, a long list of criteria, sometimes known as Sylvester\\'s Web of Conditions, places demands on the properties that any odd perfect number would need to satisfy.     \\n\\\\par \\nFor any square-free integer $d$, let $\\\\mathcal O_{\\\\mathbb{Q}(\\\\sqrt{d})}$ be the quadratic integer ring given by \\\\[\\\\mathcal O_{\\\\mathbb{Q}(\\\\sqrt{d})}=\\\\begin{cases} \\\\mathbb{Z}[\\\\frac{1+\\\\sqrt{d}}{2}], & \\\\mbox{if } d\\\\equiv 1\\\\imod{4}; \\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbb{Z}[\\\\sqrt{d}], & \\\\mbox{if } d\\\\equiv 2, 3 \\\\imod{4}. \\\\end{cases}\\\\] \\n\\\\par \\nThroughout the remainder of this paper, we will work in the rings $\\\\mathcal O_{\\\\mathbb{Q}(\\\\sqrt{d})}$ for different specific or arbitrary values of $d$. We will use the symbol ``$\\\\vert$\" to mean ``divides\" in the ring $\\\\mathcal O_{\\\\mathbb{Q}(\\\\sqrt{d})}$ in which we are working. \\nWhenever we are working in a ring other than $\\\\mathbb{Z}$, we will make sure to emphasize when we wish to state that one integer divides another in $\\\\mathbb{Z}$. \\nFor example, if we are working in $\\\\mathbb{Z}[i]$, the ring of Gaussian integers, we might say that $1+i\\\\vert 1+3i$ and that $2\\\\vert 6$ in $\\\\mathbb{Z}$. We will also refer to primes in $\\\\mathcal O_{\\\\mathbb{Q}(\\\\sqrt{d})}$ as ``primes,\" whereas we will refer to (positive) primes in $\\\\mathbb{Z}$ as ``integer primes.\" For an integer prime $p$ and a nonzero integer $n$, we will let $\\\\upsilon_p(n)$ denote the largest integer $k$ such that $p^k\\\\vert n$ in $\\\\mathbb{Z}$. For a prime $\\\\pi$ and a nonzero number $x\\\\!\\\\in\\\\!\\\\mathcal O_{\\\\mathbb{Q}(\\\\sqrt{d})}$, we will let $\\\\rho_\\\\pi(x)$ denote the largest integer $k$ such that $\\\\pi^k\\\\vert x$.  \\nFurthermore, we will henceforth focus exclusively on values of $d$ for which $\\\\mathcal O_{\\\\mathbb{Q}(\\\\sqrt{d})}$ is a unique factorization domain and $d<0$. In other words, $d\\\\in K$, where we will define $K$ to be the set $\\\\{-163,-67,-43,-19,-11,-7,-3,-2,-1\\\\}$. The set $K$ is known to be the complete set of negative values of $d$ for which $\\\\mathcal O_{\\\\mathbb{Q}(\\\\sqrt{d})}$ is a unique factorization domain \\\\cite{Stark67}.  \\n\\\\par \\nFor now, let us work in a general ring $\\\\mathcal O_{\\\\mathbb{Q}(\\\\sqrt{d})}$ such that $d\\\\!\\\\in\\\\! K$. For an element $a+b\\\\sqrt{d}\\\\in\\\\mathcal O_{\\\\mathbb{Q}(\\\\sqrt{d})}$ with $a,b\\\\in \\\\mathbb{Q}$, we define the conjugate by $\\\\overline{a+b\\\\sqrt{d}}=a-b\\\\sqrt{d}$. We also define the norm of an element $z$ by $N(z)=z\\\\overline{z}$ and the absolute value of $z$ by $\\\\vert z\\\\vert=\\\\sqrt{N(z)}$. We assume familiarity with the properties of these object, which are treated in Keith Conrad\\'s online notes \\\\cite{Conrad}. For $x,y\\\\in\\\\mathcal O_{\\\\mathbb{Q}(\\\\sqrt{d})}$, we say that $x$ and $y$ are associated, denoted $x\\\\sim y$, if and only if $x=uy$ for some unit $u$ in the ring $\\\\mathcal O_{\\\\mathbb{Q}(\\\\sqrt{d})}$. Furthermore, we will make repeated use of the following well-known facts. \\n\\\\begin{fact} \\\\label{Fact1.1}\\nLet $d\\\\!\\\\in\\\\! K$. If $p$ is an integer prime, then exactly one of the following is true. \\n\\\\begin{itemize}\\n\\\\item $p$ is also a prime in $\\\\mathcal O_{\\\\mathbb{Q}(\\\\sqrt{d})}$. In this case, we say that $p$ is inert in $\\\\mathcal O_{\\\\mathbb{Q}(\\\\sqrt{d})}$\\n\\nSummarize the preceding context in 7 sentences.

Home Entertainment\\n\\nDirector Zack Snyder, left, and Ben Affleck go over a scene on the set of \\'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.\\' (Photo11: Clay Enos)\\n\\nZack Snyder crafted the first cinematic meeting — and subsequent fisticuffs — between Batman and Superman. Offscreen, though, the director was in for a battle of another sort.\\n\\nSince March, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice has rung up $330.4 million at the box office — more than $872 million worldwide — and ranks as the year\\'s fifth-biggest movie to date. But the superhero film was also slammed with negativity, from scathing reviews to online vitriol from fans who thought Snyder was ruining the legacies of the Dark Knight (played by Ben Affleck) and Man of Steel (Henry Cavill).\\n\\nThe journey has been a “rocky road,” Snyder tells USA TODAY in an exclusive interview ahead of the movie\\'s home-viewing release. Even he thought the heroes would lose luster in his eyes after the unpleasant experience, “but every day, I wake up and these characters still have tons to say to me about the world and about heroes. I feel renewed vigor to really get their voices heard.”\\n\\nThe filmmaker says he continued to love BvS in the aftermath, when people drew up petitions asking Warner Bros. to boot him from the follow-up Justice League (in theaters Nov. 17, 2017) — even as Snyder was in pre-production. “That part was a little bit distracting,” he says, calling from London after a day of filming.\\n\\nHardest to deal with was the perception that he wasn’t being “true to canon” and didn’t adore these characters. “That was upsetting and made me evaluate myself and where I was with the movies and what I wanted to say with them.\"\\n\\nFans will see Snyder’s true BvS vision in a three-hour Ultimate Edition director’s cut that arrives June 28 on digital platforms and July 19 on Blu-ray/DVD\\n\\nSummarize the preceding context in 8 sentences.

       " 'There was a time just a few years back when the 4-inch screen was considered Apple’s big phone. After five generations of 3.5-inch screens, Apple made the iPhone taller in 2012 with the 4-inch iPhone 5. The width remained the same in a “common sense” move that maintained easy one-hand use for most people, and the 16:9 aspect ratio framed video playback perfectly. Two years later, Apple upgraded the iPhone with two new models: 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch, but no new 4-inch iPhone until now.\\n\\niPhone SE is the first upgrade to this size since the iPhone 5s in 2013. It’s a huge specs upgrade if you’re coming from an iPhone 5s, iPhone 5c, iPhone 5, or earlier. And in some cases like mine, iPhone SE is mostly on par with Apple’s iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus flagships. But there are a few limitations of varying importance plus a few oddities that should be considered before buying … even with the relatively competitive price tag on iPhone SE.\\n\\nFirst, a short rundown on the general specs:\\n\\n4-inch Retina display with 1136‑by‑640‑pixel resolution at 326 ppi\\n\\n7.6mm thin and 3.99 ounces light\\n\\n12-megapixel iSight camera with Live Photos and 4K video recording\\n\\n1.2-megapixel FaceTime HD camera with Retina Flash\\n\\nA9 + M9 chips\\n\\nFirst-generation Touch ID with Apple Pay\\n\\nAvailable in 16GB or 64GB for $399 or $499\\n\\nSold in space gray, silver, gold, or rose gold\\n\\nUp to 13 hours of Internet use on LTE on a single charge\\n\\nYou can read how that compares to the rest of the lineup here, but this is how it all translates:\\n\\niPhone SE has the smallest screen which shows less content than the iPhone 6/6s but it’s just as sharp\\n\\niPhone SE isn’t the thinnest iPhone (it’s actually the thickest in the current lineup) but it is the lightest since it’s smaller\\n\\niPhone SE has the same back camera as the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, but the design is thicker so you don’t have the camera bump\\n\\niPhone SE lights up the screen when you take a selfie, but the photo quality isn’t nearly as good as the iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, and even the 9.7-inch iPad Pro\\n\\nSpeed is just as fast as the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, which means it beats the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus by a lot, and older iPhones by even more; you can also activate Siri anytime with just your voice\\n\\niPhone SE can replace your credit card in places like Best Buy, Walgreens, and McDonalds, and the fingerprint sensor is the same as iPhone 5s, not the faster version on iPhone 6s\\n\\nThere’s no option for 128GB and most people should avoid the 16GB option, but the 64GB version if $250 cheaper than the same storage option on the iPhone 6s\\n\\nSame color options as the iPhone 5s, but space gray is slightly lighter and now you can choose rose gold\\n\\niPhone SE has the best battery life for LTE and Wi-Fi Internet use compared to any iPhone\\n\\nYou can read detailed iPhone SE specifications here and see how the current iPhone lineup compares here.\\n\\nIn my opening, I mentioned that the 4-inch iPhone was once considered Apple’s big phone. That extra half-inch certainly made it feel bigger at the time\\n\\nSummarize the preceding context in 5 sentences. Do not try to create questions or answers for your summarization.\\n\\n',\n",

       " 'Oregon State University scientists just identified a new reason why some curry dishes, made with spices humans have used for thousands of years, might be good for you.\\n\\nNew research has discovered that curcumin, a compound found in the cooking spice turmeric, can cause a modest but measurable increase in levels of a protein that\\'s known to be important in the \"innate\" immune system, helping to prevent infection in humans and other animals.\\n\\nThis cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide, or CAMP, is part of what helps our immune system fight off various bacteria, viruses or fungi even though they hadn\\'t been encountered before. Prior to this, it was known that CAMP levels were increased by vitamin D.\\n\\nDiscovery of an alternative mechanism to influence or raise CAMP levels is of scientific interest and could open new research avenues in nutrition and pharmacology, scientists said.\\n\\nTurmeric is a flavorful, orange-yellow spice and an important ingredient in many curries, commonly found in Indian, South Asian and Middle Eastern cuisine. It has also been used for 2,500 years as a medicinal compound in the Ayurvedic system of medicine in India -- not to mention being part of some religious and wedding ceremonies. In India, turmeric is treated with reverence.\\n\\nThe newest findings were made by researchers in the Linus Pauling Institute at OSU and published in the Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry, in collaboration with scientists from the University of Copenhagen in Denmark. The work was supported by the National Institutes of Health.\\n\\n\"This research points to a new avenue for regulating CAMP gene expression,\" said Adrian Gombart, an associate professor of biochemistry and biophysics in the Linus Pauling Institute. \"It\\'s interesting and somewhat surprising that curcumin can do that, and could provide another tool to develop medical therapies.\"\\n\\nThe impact of curcumin in this role is not nearly as potent as that of vitamin D, Gombart said, but could nonetheless have physiologic value. Curcumin has also been studied for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.\\n\\n\"Curcumin, as part of turmeric, is generally consumed in the diet at fairly low levels,\" Gombart said. \"However, it\\'s possible that sustained consumption over time may be healthy and help protect against infection, especially in the stomach and intestinal tract.\"\\n\\nIn this study, Chunxiao Guo, a graduate student, and Gombart looked at the potential of both curcumin and omega-3 fatty acids to increase expression of the CAMP gene. They found no particular value with the omega-3 fatty acids for this purpose, but curcumin did have a clear effect. It caused levels of CAMP to almost triple.\\n\\nThere has been intense scientific interest in the vitamin D receptor in recent years because of potential therapeutic benefits in treating infection, cancer, psoriasis and other diseases, the researchers noted in their report\\n\\nSummarize the preceding context in 8 sentences.

       " \"\\\\section{Introduction}\\n\\nSimulation of plasma and space charge has many applications in science and technology ranging from particle accelerators to satellites and medicine\\\\cite{marchand2011ptetra,lemke1999three,fourkal2002particle}.  A popular method for simulation of plasma is particle-in-cell (PIC) which self-consistently evolves particle motion for charge species with Maxwell’s Equations. \\nTraditionally PIC has been based on finite difference time domain with the domain represented by Yee cells\\\\cite{yee1966numerical}. The stair stepping nature of a structured grid presents challenges on geometry modeling especially fine features and multi-scale objects. Methods such as cut-cells\\\\cite{grote2005warp} have been developed to alleviate this challenge. Another fundamental bottleneck is that these methods are conditionally stable, with time step size of the field solver dictated by the mesh, and is relatively small so as to satisfy the Courant-Friedrich-Levy condition. As a result, there has been renewed interest in developing methods that not only better represent the geometry but better capture the underlying physics. \\n\\nThe route taken is to use finite element methods (FEMS); they have an extensive history of use in field solvers due to their ability to better represent the geometry and physics. But more importantly, there is a well developed rigorous body of literature \\\\cite{monk2003finite,bossavit1991student,bossavitwhitney}  on the mathematical foundation of FEM.  Indeed, as is to be expected, FEM has made inroads into PIC modeling more of late with some excellent work rubrics of this approach\\\\cite{perse2021geometric,ricketson2020energy,he2016hamiltonian,hirvijoki2020subcycling,evstatiev2013variational,xiao2016explicit,pinto2021variational,morrison2017structure,jianyuan2018structure,kormann2021energy,burby2017finite,qin2015canonical,he2015hamiltonian,shadwick2014variational,crouseilles2015hamiltonian,stamm2014variational,xiao2013variational}. Of particular note in seminal work in \\\\cite{pinto2014charge}, wherein rubrics for charge conservation for FEM-PIC where developed. These have been refined and developed further in a series \\\\cite{moon2015exact,na2017axisymmetric,na2018relativistic}. By and large, these papers follow a similar rubric, use a leap-frog scheme to step through a solution for the field, update position and velocity of the particle and solve for the fields again. In this setting, it was shown that the methodology is charge conserving. While this the classical PIC cycle, a more recent trend has been to solve both the electromagnetic and Newton's equations self-consistently at the same time step\\\\cite{kormann2021energy}. This approach necessary when the motion is close to being relativistic. \\n\\nIn the problems that we address in this paper, our motion is non-relativistic. As a result, we are in the regime where the classic PIC is valid. Even so, being restricted to a time step size that is tightly related to the mesh is undesirable, especially, when there are a number of well established methods that make the field solver unconditionally stable \\\\cite{zienkiewicz1977new}. Unfortunately, developing a method where Gauss' laws and equation of continuity is satisfied is not a trivial task. As an aside, in the rest of the paper, we will use the term \\\\emph{conservation laws} to denote these equations and admit to an abuse of terminology! This problem was solved relatively recently \\\\cite{2021arXiv210206248O,crawford2021rubrics} with results demonstrating satisfaction of conservation laws to almost machine precision\\n\\nSummarize the preceding context in 5 sentences.

       " 'It is with great regret that we are announcing the closure of Little Stoke parkrun.\\n\\nThis is a disappointing outcome for everyone at parkrun, the dedicated team of volunteers who have worked so hard on the event since 2012, and of course the participants who have benefitted so much from a free, local, accessible 5k every Saturday morning in Little Stoke Park.\\n\\nSince the vote, on the 12th of April, by Stoke Gifford Parish Council to introduce a charge for Little Stoke parkrun, we have made attempts to engage with the council to offer alternative ways of contributing to the sustainability of the park. Every parkrun is a partnership between the landowner, the volunteer team and the local community, and unfortunately we were unable to convince Stoke Gifford Parish Council of the true value of the event. Our intention has never been to force parkrun onto the Council, but instead to demonstrate the benefits that weekly, free, fun, physical activity provides to their community.\\n\\nTherefore, as the Council has now revoked our permission to run in Little Stoke Park for free, we have taken the difficult decision to bring things to a conclusion and, for the first time, permanently close one of our free, weekly, timed runs.\\n\\nTom Williams, Chief Operating Officer for parkrun, said:\\n\\n\"Over the past 12 years parkrun has grown from 13 runners in one park to 150,000 runners at 900 locations around the world, every week. Key to this success has been our determination to remove as many barriers to participation as possible, with cost being one of the most critical. Stoke Gifford Parish Council\\'s initial request for us to charge our runners £1 per week went completely against our most fundamental principles and, as a free event, their subsequently revised requirement for parkrun to contribute financially to the maintenance of the park is also something we are unable to do. From the outset, and despite significant efforts from many people inside and outside of parkrun, we were unable to convince them of the true value that a parkrun event provides to its local community.\\n\\n“Personally I feel a great sense of sadness, however I also feel a phenomenal sense of pride in how the Little Stoke parkrun community has dealt with this extremely challenging situation. From start to finish they have gone above and beyond what I would ever have expected from a volunteer team, and they could have done no more.\\n\\n“If there is a positive to be taken from this experience it is surely that we have all been motivated to consider what our wonderful areas of open space mean to us, and how important it is that we do everything we can to ensure they remain fully accessible to their local communities. It is also critical that we do everything we can to support our local authorities and landowners, ensuring our parks are there for future generations to enjoy just as much as we do.”\\n\\nBecky Bushnell, co-Event Director of Little Stoke parkrun, said:\\n\\n“We are all really disappointed that Little Stoke parkrun has found itself in this position. The past eight months have been a difficult time for the volunteer team as all we have ever wanted to do is run, jog and walk in the park with friends.

       " \"Eyefi is releasing a new Wi-Fi-enabled SD card today that's meant to make transferring RAW photos from a card to a computer more convenient for photographers. The new card is called the Mobi Pro, and it'll be the first in Eyefi's Mobi line that's capable of handling RAW files and connecting to local Wi-Fi networks. Earlier Eyefi cards were also capable of those feats, but Eyefi is now bringing those abilities to the Mobi line, which is supposed to be easier to set up than its other cards.\\n\\nSelective sync may not be as convenient as it sounds\\n\\nThe Mobi Pro also has one other big feature new to this card line: selective sync. Other Eyefi cards work by automatically syncing all of your photos from the card to your phone or computer, but the Mobi Pro will, optionally, let you choose which photos to sync. That should be a huge help, although the implementation sounds less than convenient. To choose which photos to sync, you'll have to mark each one for write protection on the camera, which isn't always a quick thing to do.\\n\\nLike other Mobi cards, the Mobi Pro will primarily sync photos over to your phone. Because it's able to connect to local Wi-Fi networks, it's also able to sync straight to a desktop, if that's what you prefer. As for those huge RAW files, those will only be stored on a phone until Mobi's mobile app can push them up to the cloud and over to your desktop. Eyefi expects that most people will primarily use the card to get RAW files to their desktop, but its cloud service can also hang onto them, without any limits, so long as you're subscribed.\\n\\nThe Mobi Pro is only available in a single 32GB, Class 10 model. It'll sell for $99.99, replacing the old Pro X2 card. The Mobi Pro will also include one year of access to Eyefi's cloud-storage service, which offers unlimited storage for $49.99 per year. Of course, for pros, plugging an SD card into a reader isn't exactly the roughest part of their workflow, so Eyefi's new card may not make a lot of sense for everyone. Then again, it could be a good choice if you're also in the market for a new MacBook\\n\\nSummarize the preceding context in 5 sentences.

       " \"\\\\section{Introduction}\\nThe nightside auroral zone ionosphere has long been a subject of study \\\\citep{Fukushima1994}, being a region of dynamic current structures which interconnect with the inner magnetosphere \\\\citep{McPherron1973}. During geomagnetically active periods, changing ionospheric currents occur in the auroral zone. Resulting geoelectric fields present a potential hazard: the excitation of geomagnetically induced currents (GIC) in conducting infrastructure such as power transmission networks and pipelines \\\\citep{Bolduc2002,Boteler2003,Lundstedt2006}. The relatively low frequency of GIC variations, compared to the operating frequency of the power transmission network, means GIC can produce a quasi-DC voltage bias of transformers. This can saturate the core of the transformer, producing harmonic distortion of the transformer voltage \\\\citep{Boteler2001}. For auroral zone power infrastructure, substorms, pulsations, and horizontal geomagnetic perturbations constitute major drivers of geomagnetic activity which may cause power system disruption \\\\citep{Guillon2016,Boteler2019,Kappenman2005,Pulkkinen2003,Stauning2013,Ngwira2015}. It is possible that large impulsive magnetic events may act as another source of GIC. If these events were to have a prominent vertical component, Faraday's Law would indicate that the resultant large vertical magnetic flux changes produced from these events should induce similarly large horizontal geoelectric fields. Commonly, when modeling geoelectric fields based on ground magnetometer measurements, $B_z$ measurements are neglected, using the plane-wave assumption \\\\citep{WaitJamesRG,Boteler2017}. We present a statistical study including the occurrence of $B_z$ impulsive events and their relation to GIC.\\n\\nHarmonic distortion (HD) is often used as an indicator of the stress applied to a power transmission network due to GIC \\\\citep{NZHD,Clilverd2020,Bolduc2002}. GIC in transformers within a power transmission network have a spectral content with frequencies much lower than the normal 60 Hz operating frequency of the network. Therefore they can be approximated as quasi-DC currents. Transformer cores within a network may become partially saturated due to the introduction of GIC, resulting in distortion of the AC signal. This can be quantified as HD \\\\citep{GICHD}. The Hydro-Qu\\\\'ebec network has been extensively instrumented to measure HD, which provides a continuous record of space weather impacts to the network \\\\citep{Kamwa2006}. As a result, this study uses HD as an indicator of GIC-driven stress on the power transmission network.\\n\\nPrevious statistical studies of impulsive geomagnetic events examined impulses measured on the dayside in the cusp regions \\\\citep{doi:10.1029/GL013i011p01089,Lanzerotti1991}. One study considered auroral-zone impulsive events but limited to horizontal geomagnetic perturbations \\\\citep{Moretto2004}. Some more recent studies have looked at impulsive geomagnetic perturbations on the nightside, but have principally focused on impulsive perturbations in the polar cap \\\\citep{Engebretson2019} or in a storm context \\\\citep{Engebretson2019b}. This study seeks to characterize the latitudinal distribution of impulsive magnetic events, their diurnal distribution in magnetic local time (MLT), their amplitude, which component is dominant, and their relation to power network disturbances. We characterize these events in the aggregate and find that most geoeffective events are associated with vertical disturbances.\\n\\n\\\\section{Materials and Methods}\\n\\\\subsection{Source Data}\\n\\nWe analyze data from two sources: ground-based magnetometers and synchrophasor measurements of voltage distortion at substation transformers\\n\\nSummarize the preceding context in 5 sentences.

       " \"\\\\section{Introduction} \\n\\nExtensions to general relativity have become a subject of intense interest \\nin the last decade, due to both observational evidence for acceleration of \\nthe cosmic expansion and intriguing new theoretical work. For general \\nrelativity to explain cosmic acceleration it requires a physical \\nenergy-momentum component that violates the strong energy condition, for \\nexample a cosmological constant or scalar field with highly negative \\npressure. These explanations have difficulties with fine tuning and \\nnaturalness, so an attractive alternative has been to consider altering \\nthe structure of the gravitational action itself, e.g.\\\\ through \\nscalar-tensor theories, higher dimensional gravity, or massive gravitons. \\n\\nInventing a sound, consistent gravity theory is no easy task, and furthermore \\nthe theory must satisfy observational cosmology constraints such as an early \\nuniverse behavior similar to general relativity, with radiation and matter \\ndomination, a deviation near the present to explain cosmic acceleration, \\nand growth of large scale massive structures not too dissimilar from in \\ngeneral relativity. Indeed the specific expansion and growth histories, \\nand their comparison, provide one of the key signatures of modified gravity. \\nThe evolution of linear density perturbations, and their gravitational \\nlensing of light, can be phrased in terms of, respectively, nonrelativistic \\nand relativistic modified Poisson equations where Newton's constant becomes \\ntwo distinct functions of space and time. These effective gravitational \\nstrengths can not only differ from Newton's constant, but from each other; \\nthis divergence is called the gravitational slip. \\n\\nObservationally there are no constraints yet on cosmological gravitational \\nwaves, but many modified theories predict that their propagation will differ \\nfrom general relativity; \\nin particular, as we focus on here, the sound speed of these tensor \\nperturbations may deviate from the speed of light. \\nRecently, \\n\\\\cite{14067139} illustrated a relation between the gravitational slip \\nand the gravitational wave propagation in several modified gravity theories: \\na deviation in one led to a deviation in the other. \\n\\nHere we consider the generality of such a relation.

       " 'Amazon RDS now offers Multi-AZ support for Amazon RDS for SQL Server. This new high availability option leverages SQL Server Mirroring technology with additional improvements to meet the requirements of enterprise-grade production workloads running on SQL Server. The Multi-AZ deployment option provides enhanced availability and data durability by automatically replicating database updates between two AWS Availability Zones. Availability Zones are physically separate locations with independent infrastructure engineered to be insulated from failures in other Availability Zones.\\n\\nWhen you create or modify your SQL Server database instance to run using Multi-AZ, Amazon RDS will automatically provision a primary database in one Availability Zone and maintain a synchronous \"standby\" replica in a different Availability Zone. In the event of planned database maintenance or unplanned service disruption, Amazon RDS will automatically fail over the SQL Server database to the up-to-date standby so that database operations can resume quickly without any manual intervention.\\n\\nMulti-AZ is available with Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 and 2012 Standard and Enterprise Editions. It is presently available in the US West (Oregon) and EU (Ireland) AWS Regions, with availability in the US East (Northern Virginia) region coming soon.

In this article we will use quasi-categories.\\r\\nIn the the context of dg-categories a related result has appeared in  \\\\cite{toen2007moduli}: let $S$ be an affine scheme, and $X\\\\xrightarrow fS$ a smooth and proper morphism of schemes. Then the stack $\\\\Perf_{X/S}$ of families of perfect complexes along $f$ is locally algebraic and locally of finite type \\\\cite{toen2007moduli}*{Corollary 3.29}. Let $E$ be a perfect complex on $X$. This result implies that $\\\\Aut_{X/S}(E)$ is algebraic. Using a similar argument to there, we can show that, at least as long as we are only interested in the Hom stacks, we can drop the smoothness assumption:\\r\\n\\\\begin{customthm}{\\\\ref{thm:RHom is algebraic}}\\r\\n Let $X\\\\xrightarrow fS$ be a proper morphism of quasi-compact and quasi-separated schemes, and $E,F$ perfect complexes on $X$. Then the stack of families of morphisms $\\\\SRHom_{X/S}(E,F)$ is algebraic.\\r\\n\\\\end{customthm}\\r\\nIn particular, this shows that in this generality, $\\\\Aut_{X/S}(E)$ is algebraic.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Section \\\\ref{s:deformation theory} we study the deformation theory of the stack of automorphisms.\\r\\nThe deformation theory of complexes in derived categories has been studied in \\r\\n\\\\cite{lieblich2006moduli} and \\\\cite{huybrechts2010}. We modify the usual argument for deformations of a morphism of modules,\\r\\nas presented in \\\\cite{illusie}, to obtain obstructions and deformations.\\r\\nThe obstruction to lifting a point of ${\\\\rm Aut}(E)$ lies inside $\\\\Ext^1(E,E)$. In the case that\\r\\nthis obstruction vanishes, the $\\\\infty$-group $\\\\Aut(E)$ is smooth. Using this, we can prove a version of the Hilbert 90 Theorem for perfect complexes.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet $X$ be a scheme, and $E,F$ be $\\\\mathscr O_X$-modules. Let $\\\\tau$ be a (Grothendieck) topology on $X$\\n\\nSummarize the preceding context in 6 sentences. Do not try to create questions or answers for your summarization.\\n\\n',\n",

Since such\\r\\nmicroswimmers generally function at small scales, their transport\\r\\ndynamics are intrinsically stochastic. Therefore, how to work against\\r\\nsuch inherent fluctuations with good performance is of great importance\\r\\nfor their designs \\\\citep{jahanshahi2017brownian,liebchen2019optimal,van2008dynamics,muratore2014nanomechanical,nemoto2019optimizing,pietzonka2019autonomous}.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere, we address such an issue by studying a general model of Brownian\\r\\ncircle swimmer in a 2D plane (see Fig.\\\\ref{fig:1}), subjected to\\r\\nan active force with constant amplitude $F_{0}$, an internal torque\\r\\n$M$ and an external harmonic potential with strength $k$. By using\\r\\nthe framework of stochastic thermodynamics \\\\citep{seifert2012stochastic,seifert2008stochastic,seifert2019stochastic,jarzynski2011equalities},\\r\\nwe have analyzed the heat dissipation of the system as a function\\r\\nof $F_{0}$, $M$ and $k$, identified as thermodynamic cost of the\\r\\nswimmer. Interestingly, we find that there exists an optimal torque\\r\\nsuch that the cyclic cost $Q_{cyc}$ could reach a minimum value,\\r\\nwhich serves as a lower bound for the cost to sustain a stable circular\\r\\nmotion. In addition, a trade-off relation between the precision of\\r\\nthe circular motion and the thermodynamic cost has been found, indicating\\r\\nthat an increased energy supply is needed to maintain punctual transport\\r\\nprocess as expected. By utilizing the thermodynamic uncertainty relations(TURs)\\r\\n\\\\citep{barato2015thermodynamic}, we have also obtained an analytical\\r\\nexpression for the transport efficiency $\\\\chi_{\\\\theta}$, which properly\\r\\nquantifies the performance of the swimmer to work with large speed,\\r\\nhigh precision, but low cost. With these results, we are able to propose\\r\\nproper strategies for designing swimmers under certain constraints,\\r\\nfor instance, when the cyclic energy supply $Q_{0}$ is limited. Analysis\\r\\nshows that the maximum $\\\\chi_{\\\\theta}$ increases with increasing\\r\\n$Q_{0}$, which can be further enhanced by increasing the external\\r\\npotential strength $k$. Finally, we illustrate our predicted design\\r\\nprinciples and strategies by numerical simulations.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\\begin{figure}\\r\\n\\\\begin{centering}\\r\\n\\\\includegraphics[width=1\\\\columnwidth]{0}\\r\\n\\\\par\\\\end{centering}\\r\\n\\\\caption{Schematic sketch of cargo delivering by various types of Brownian\\r\\ncircle swimmers.

$\\\\alpha_1=-\\\\theta$, in the case \\nwhen ${\\\\mathfrak g}$ is of classical type.  \\nUsing the family of involutions above\\nwe prove the second main result of the paper, Theorem \\\\ref{intro:

       " 'With 2014 being ESPN’s World Cup swan song, there’s more intrigue now than ever before as to what the tournament will look like when Fox takes over rights after this year’s tournament. As we’ve discussed on this website previously, the journey for Fox as America’s flagship soccer network begins next year with the Women’s World Cup and their ever-growing soccer package.\\n\\nFox’s soccer coverage has lagged far behind the critical and fan acclaim of NBCSN’s EPL offering and ESPN’s coverage of the World Cup. Fox took a major risk with Gus Johnson being the face of their soccer coverage, and so far the results have been a very mixed bag at best, with many fans losing patience with the network. I still think Johnson has potential, but he needs many more reps working lower profile games to truly grow into the role and announce major club games, let alone be a World Cup lead announcer.\\n\\nA bigger issue might be who Fox has paired alongside Johnson as their lead broadcast team at the moment, Eric Wynalda. The former USMNT star is typical Fox panache in that he’s more volatile and outspoken than soccer analysts working at other networks currently. Wynalda’s short time in the booth alongside Johnson has also drawn the ire of fans and critics.\\n\\nIt flew under the radar this week, but Wynalda had a bizarre appearance on The Dan Patrick Show in the wake of the USA’s Round of 16 loss to Belgium. And it won’t encourage anyone looking forward to Fox’s takeover of World Cup coverage.\\n\\nWynalda was obviously very irritable with the defeat, had to be calmed down by Patrick, dropped a word you can’t say on national radio, and called head coach Jurgen Klinsmann “un-American.”\\n\\nAnd this is Fox’s current lead soccer analyst???\\n\\n“This whole country is singing this song I believe. The only guy who didn’t believe was Jurgen. That’s hard on the players, that’s hard on all the people in this country who are really ready to get behind this sport, who were congregating in places like Solider Field… Man, that’s just almost un-American for us to go out there and strap one arm behind our back and take 1,000 punches.”\\n\\nWynalda can criticize Klinsmann all he wants, but you wouldn’t hear one of ESPN or NBC’s soccer analysts put forward a scorching hot take like this that belongs with the likes of Skip Bayless and Stephen A. Smith. (Michael Wilbon not withstanding, of course.) To imply that Jurgen Klinsmann, the way he set up his team, or the way they played against Belgium was somehow treasonous to our country is a leap nobody with a properly functioning brain should make. Or at least be allowed to say to a national audience.\\n\\nTo have this appearance represent Fox Sports and the future of American soccer coverage is a very worrisome thing for fans. To go from people like Bob Ley, Mike Tirico, Ian Darke, and Taylor Twellman to Eric Wynalda shouting and swearing about whatever is not a comforting message at all from the next rightsholder for how they will treat the sport. In fact, it does little but confirm the worst fears about Fox taking the outstanding work ESPN has done with the World Cup and driving it off a cliff.\\n\\nWhat has made ESPN and NBC’s soccer coverage so appreciated by fans is that it’s free of the buffoonery seen elsewhere in the sports world. There’s no talk of “clutch genes” or “who choked worse” or questioning the “Americanness” of those involved with the sport. ESPN and NBC treat the sport and the viewer with the ultimate respect, and that is why they are so admired as some of the best productions in sport. You could put NBC’s EPL coverage and ESPN’s World Cup package against any other property as the absolute best in the field. Fox Soccer is far off the pace at the moment. And if this Wynalda rant is any indication, they are falling further behind.\\n\\nHopefully this can be a wake up call for Fox. They can watch ESPN’s World Cup coverage very closely and take the best elements of what has made it such a success over the last four years and build on it\\n\\nSummarize the preceding context in 5 sentences.

       " 'By Robert Campbell\\n\\nNEW YORK, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Russia’s decade of investment in new oil export capacity is turning the table on inland European refineries. Where once they were privileged customers at the end of a dedicated export pipeline they are now fighting at a disadvantage for crude.\\n\\nThe situation in the Czech Republic is an excellent example. Local oil refiner Ceska Rafinerska has been forced to shut down its Kralupy plant due to a lack of crude oil.\\n\\nThe Kralupy refinery used to get the bulk of its oil from the Druzhba (Friendship) pipeline, a Cold War-era system that connects inland European refineries with Russian oil fields.\\n\\nBut the growth in Russian oil export capacity, such as the new Ust-Luga port in the Baltic, as well as increased Russian domestic oil refinery runs, are limiting the amount of crude oil Russian producers send down Druzhba.\\n\\n(For a related column, see: )\\n\\nOr in other words, when prices offered at sea terminals are more attractive than those on the pipeline, Russian producers will opt to send more oil to the terminals.\\n\\nOf course, the relative attractiveness of various sales points has plenty to do with the cost of moving crude oil from Russian fields to its destination, and this is something that can be manipulated by Russian pipeline operators.\\n\\nAnd that means the brutal economics of arbitrage now work against inland refiners. To secure Russian crude they must now pay a high enough price to be at least as attractive a destination as sea-borne exports.\\n\\nUnfavorable pipeline tariffs mean they must pay even more. Making matters worse, particularly for the most isolated refineries such as those in the Czech Republic, is a legacy of underinvestment in alternative pipeline routes.\\n\\nKralupy was forced to shut down because it had simply exhausted its allocation of pipeline capacity on the TAL line that runs from the Adriatic Sea across the Alps, the only other pipeline that is connected to the plant.\\n\\nENERGY SECURITY\\n\\nNot surprisingly, this situation has come as a stark reminder of the energy security problems facing much of Central Europe. A failure to diversify away from Russian supplies has left inland refineries vulnerable to resurgent Russian crude oil pricing power.\\n\\nHere, some observers detect a Russian plan to take greater control of Europe’s downstream oil refining sector. Russian firms are deliberately squeezing inland European refineries to force them to sell out, they say.\\n\\nAlready Rosneft, a major Russian producer, has indicated that it is looking into boosting shipments on Druzhba to refineries it part owns in Germany that have been affected by the bottlenecks on the TAL line.\\n\\nYet even if all the inland oil refineries in Europe were owned by Russian oil producers, it is far from clear that this situation would be resolved.\\n\\nThe fact is that Europe still has far too much refining capacity, which is part of the reason why inland refiners cannot afford to invest in new sources of supply.\\n\\nWhat is really occurring here is a transition of the overhaul of the European refining sector. While Russian export options were limited, inland refineries had a profit cushion due to relatively cheap crude prices, similar to the situation now enjoyed by inland North American refineries.\\n\\nCheap crude, and local politics, shielded many inland refineries from the market forces that forced other plants, more exposed to world prices, to shut down.\\n\\nNow with the proliferation of Russian export outlets, these refineries have lost their advantage in crude oil pricing.\\n\\nCombine that with a lack of alternatives to Russian oil supplies and it is clear that inland European plants, particularly those not aligned with an upstream oil producer, are increasingly vulnerable\\n\\nSummarize the preceding context in 8 sentences.

That’s when we came into the picture” – Alex\\n\\nDespite the changes to the local staple, however, Foxtail is excited to aid the former resident in fulfilling her long-term retirement dream.\\n\\n“She ran a very successful business for a very long time – it seemed like her retirement program hinged on the liquidation of her real estate and she could now live off of the real estate funds. She couldn’t retire until she sold that [property].” – Iain Yeakle\\n\\nSlightly outside of Orlando’s Bungalower districts will be Foxtail’s largest location in Altamonte Springs. As their first-ever drive thru location, Altamonte customers will enjoy Foxtail favorites, expansive patio seating and considerable parking for those stopping in. Foxtail Altamonte will also provide customers more food and beverage options direct from their in-house kitchen.\\n\\nThrough their rapid expansion, it’s evident the partners have impacted local Orlando in a big way. Nearing the one-year anniversary of Foxtail’s flagship location, the Winter Park staple is quickly approaching their next-door expansion.\\n\\nLess than a month out from its public unveiling, the Farmhouse will feature the world’s largest coffee siphon bar, equipped with 14 individual burners. Complementing the bar will be a commissary selling light bites, like sandwiches and pastries, all sourced from local vendors.\\n\\nThe main coffee shop itself will face minor changes so customers can access the coffee shop and Farmhouse from one another for a continuous experience.\\n\\n“The Farmhouse closes off completely for private events but still connects to Foxtail Coffee. This allows us to have private events [at the Farmhouse] and still have Foxtail Coffee open.”-Alex\\n\\nUnlike any of their other locations, the Farmhouse will also cater to the after-hours crowd\\n\\nSummarize the preceding context in 6 sentences.

       " 'The Second Session of the 107th Tennessee General Assembly convened on Tuesday, and it did not take long for the members to set the bar lower than ever before in introducing bad legislation.\\n\\nJust a little over 48 hours ago, the Bathroom Harassment Act (SB 2282/HB 2279) was filed by two Hamilton County Republicans, Senator Bo Watson of Hixson and Representative Richard Floyd of Chattanooga.\\n\\nThe Bathroom Harassment Act restricts access to public restrooms and public dressing rooms designated by sex to members of that particular sex. Using the person\\'s birth certificate, a person would face a Class C Misdemeanor, with a fine of up to $50.\\n\\nThe Tennessee Transgender Political Coalition feels that while this bill is a direct attack on the rights of Tennessee\\'s transgender community, transgender people would not be the only people harassed under this bill should it become law. It would affect lots of other gender variant and gender non conforming people who do not necessarily identify as trans. Furthermore, it would criminalize plumbers and cleaning personnel who operate in restrooms the opposite of their birth gender.\\n\\nThe bill would also affect families who take their children with them into restrooms in shopping malls, restaurants, theaters, and sporting events. Are we now going to arrest the parents, or children, or both, for violating this new law?\\n\\nTennessee also has many people who visit the state to enjoy our many tourist sites, from Dollywood to Graceland, as well as to transfer at Tennessee airports in Memphis and Nashville. If any of them wish to use a restroom while they are in the state and they do not have their birth certificates with them to prove identity, are we now going to arrest them?\\n\\nWe are also curious to see how Senator Watson and Representative Floyd intend to set up this new Bathroom Identification bureacracy. Who will be responsible for checking everyone\\'s birth certificates? If a person does not carry their birth certificate with them, will they be denied access to a facility? And how do they intend to pay for this new Big Government agency in the bathroom stalls? Do they propose raising taxes, or will they seek to cut the budgets of superflous agencies like Department of Education or Department of Health? Does this mean that doctors, nurses, and teachers are less important than Bathroom stall monitors?\\n\\nThere are also serious Constitutional questions surrounding this bill, since the Fourth Amendment protects persons \"from unreasonable searches and seizures.\"\\n\\nWhile there have been many attempts to scare people about transgender people using bathrooms, including a well circulated video previously used in anti-transgender campaigns in Florida and Michigan, the only documented incidents all show the transgender person as the victims, not the perpatrators of the abuse. The April 2011 beating of Chrissy Lee Polis at a Baltimore McDonald\\'s led to charges of Hate Crimes in Maryland against the two women who beat Ms. Polis. In Tennessee, they would probably be hired as supervisors in the new Tennessee Bathroom Security Agency.\\n\\nWe feel this bill is the latest in a growing string of embarrassing bills in Tennessee.\\n\\nWe urge all of you to contact Senator Watson (615-741-3227 or sen\\n\\nSummarize the preceding context in 4 sentences.

       " '\\\\section{Introduction}\\n\\\\label{s:intoduction}\\nAlmost all the extensions of the Standard Model~(SM) directed towards an explanation for the neutrino masses brings in the possibility of\\nlepton number violation~(LNV) as an outcome. It is well known that neutrinoless double beta\\ndecay~($0\\\\nu\\\\beta\\\\beta~{\\\\rm decay}$) which is a convincing signature for LNV, will be an inevitable consequence if\\nthe neutrino has Majorana mass. If the main contribution to $0\\\\nu\\\\beta\\\\beta~{\\\\rm decay}$ proceeds through the Majorana neutrino propagator,\\ndepending on the spectrum of the neutrino masses,\\nthe expected rate for $0\\\\nu\\\\beta\\\\beta~{\\\\rm decay}$ might be too small to be observed in the experiments. \\nBut there exist scenarios where the dominant mechanism for $0\\\\nu\\\\beta\\\\beta~{\\\\rm decay}$ is not controlled\\nby the Majorana neutrino propagator. In such cases we can have the possibility of large\\n$0\\\\nu\\\\beta\\\\beta~{\\\\rm decay}$ even when the neutrino Majorana masses are small. Many studies have been performed\\nin this direction in the past (see Refs.~\\\\cite{Schechter:1981bd,Mohapatra:1998rq,Vergados:2012xy} for a general overview,\\nRefs.~\\\\cite{Pati:1974yy,Mohapatra:1974gc,Senjanovic:1975rk,Hirsch:1996qw,Atre:2009rg,Tello:2010am,Blennow:2010th,Ibarra:2010xw,Mitra:2011qr,Dev:2013vxa,Dev:2014xea,Choubey:2012ux,Babu:2010vp,Gustafsson:2012vj,Liu:2016mpf,Jin:2015cla,Okada:2015hia,Ahriche:2014cda,Hatanaka:2014tba,Chen:2014ska,Geng:2015sza,Nishiwaki:2015iqa,Ahriche:2015wha} for specific models\\\\footnote{See also \\\\cite{Helo:2015fba} for a recent review of neutrino mass models in connection to $0\\\\nu\\\\beta\\\\beta~{\\\\rm decay}$.} and Refs.~\\\\cite{Choi:2002bb,Engel:2003yr,deGouvea:2007qla,delAguila:2012nu} for effective field theory~(EFT) approaches). In Ref.~\\\\cite{delAguila:2012nu}, the authors\\nperformed an EFT analysis of the different ways of generating $0\\\\nu\\\\beta\\\\beta~{\\\\rm decay}$ and light neutrino\\nmasses by including operators involving only leptons, Higgs and gauge bosons. This led\\nto a class of interesting models where $0\\\\nu\\\\beta\\\\beta~{\\\\rm decay}$ was generated at tree level whereas\\nneutrino masses would appear only at two-loops (see Refs.~\\\\cite{delAguila:2011gr}\\nfor example models in this category).\\n\\nThe model in Ref.~\\\\cite{delAguila:2011gr} contains an $SU(2)_L$ singlet doubly charged\\nscalar like in the Zee-Babu model\\\\cite{Zee:1985id,Babu:1988ki,Babu:2002uu}, an $SU(2)_L$\\ntriplet scalar with hypercharge $+1$ and a real singlet scalar. A $Z_2$ symmetry, which is\\nlater broken spontaneously, is required to prevent tree-level neutrino masses. The model is\\neconomical in the sense that it contains no new fermions and by design, it gives new\\ncontributions to $0\\\\nu\\\\beta\\\\beta~{\\\\rm decay}$, which, in principle, can be large. Additionally, it has a rich\\nphenomenology which can be probed through the searches for the lepton flavor \\nviolating~(LFV) signals and/or the direct searches for the new scalars in the collider\\nexperiments.\\n\\nIn this article we will present a simple variation of the model in Ref.~\\\\cite{delAguila:2011gr}.\\nOur new model will have the same field content as in Ref.~\\\\cite{delAguila:2011gr}, except that\\nthe $Z_2$ symmetry will not be broken spontaneously. Consequently, $0\\\\nu\\\\beta\\\\beta~{\\\\rm decay}$ will now occur\\nat one-loop whereas neutrino masses will appear at three-loop order. The fact the $Z_2$ is exact makes the model simpler and allows for a viable Dark Matter~(DM) candidate: the lightest of the electrically neutral $Z_2$-odd particles\\n\\nSummarize the preceding context in 8 sentences.

       " \"\\\\section{Introduction}\\nScattering phenomenon happens in many branches of sciences and engineering.\\nA physical state typically has a rate of oscillation and a rate of decay. Scattering resonances generalize eigenvalues or bound states for those physical states in\\nwhich energy can scatter to infinity with a rate of oscillation and in a rate of decaying. The concept appears to be intrinsically dynamical, \\nbut the mathematical formulation comes from\\nconsidering the meromorphic continuations of Green's functions or scattering\\nmatrices. The poles of these meromorphic continuations capture the physical information by identifying the rate of oscillations with the real part of\\na pole, and the rate of decay with its imaginary part. \\n\\\\par\\nMathematically, resonances are defined as the poles in the meromorphic extension of resolvent \\n\\\\begin{equation}\\\\label{111}\\nR(k):=(-D^{2}+V-k^{2})^{{-1}}:L^{2}(\\\\mathbb{R})\\\\rightarrow L^{2}(\\\\mathbb{R})\\n\\\\end{equation}\\nfrom the upper half complex plane $\\\\mathbb{C}^{+}:=\\\\{\\\\Im k>0\\\\}$ to the whole complex plane, where $D$ is the differentiation to space varaiable. In the lower half complex $\\\\mathbb{C}^{-}$, the continuation will not exist as an operator in $L^{2}(\\\\mathbb{R})$. Therefore, we consider the extended resolvent as maps between suitable spaces of exponentially weighted spaces \\\\cite{Dyatlov,Froese,Hitrik,Zworski}.

       " \"\\\\section{Introduction}\\n\\t\\n\\tEach day competitive contests between similar entities occur in the hope of one proving dominant over the other. These contests have been shown to be wide-ranging with examples including animals combating in order to prove their strength~\\\\cite{Chase2002, Ellis2017}, online content producers aiming to create a popular post~\\\\cite{Weng2012, Gleeson2014, Lorenz-Spreen2019}, or the quantification of the scientific quality underlying a researcher's output~\\\\cite{Lehmann2006, Radicchi2008, Radicchi2009, Sinatra2016}. In most of these scenarios it proves difficult to ultimately determine the stronger of two such competitors for a number of reasons, most evidently  the lack of explicit quantitative data describing the corresponding result from each contest. One noticeable exemption to this predicament is in the case of competitive sports where, on the contrary, there exists an abundance of data available from extended periods of time describing the results of  contests. This source of empirical data has resulted in an entire domain of study in applying the theoretical concepts of complex systems to the field of sport~\\\\cite{Passos2011, Davids2013, Wasche2017}. \\n\\t\\n\\tThe application of these tools has resulted in a greater understanding of the dynamics underlying a number of sporting contests including soccer~\\\\cite{Grund2012, Buldu2019}, baseball~\\\\cite{Petersen2008, Saavedra2010},  basketball~\\\\cite{Gabel2012, Clauset2015, Ribeiro2016}, and more recently even virtual sporting contests based upon actual sports~\\\\cite{Getty2018, OBrien2020}. An area that has received much focus and which is most relevant to the present work is the application of network science~\\\\cite{Newman2010} in identifying important sporting competitors in both team and individual sports. This has led to analysis in a range of sports including team-based games such as soccer where the identification of important players within a team's structure has been considered~\\\\cite{Onody2004, Duch2010} and cricket, where rankings of both teams and the most influential player in specialty roles including captains, bowlers, and batsmen have been considered~\\\\cite{Mukherjee2012, Mukherjee2014}. Analysis has also been conducted into individual-based sports, again with the aim of providing a ranking of players within a given sport. For example, the competitors within both professional tennis~\\\\cite{Radicchi2011} and boxers, at an individual weight level~\\\\cite{TennantBoxing17} and a pound-for-pound level~\\\\cite{Tennant20}, have been extensively studied. Lastly, rankings at a country level based upon their success across the spectrum of Olympic Games sports  have also been considered~\\\\cite{Calzada-Infante2016}.\\n\\t\\n\\tIn this article we focus on the application of network science to the sport of Snooker --- a cue-based game with its origins in the late $19^{\\\\text{th}}$ century from the military bases of British officers based in India. The game is played on a cloth-covered rectangular table which has six pockets located at the four corners and two along the middle of the longer sides. The players strike the cue ball (which is white) with their cue such that it strikes another of the 21 colored balls which is then ideally pocketed ,i.e., it falls into one of the pockets. The order in which the different colored balls must be pocketed is pre-determined and a player is awarded different points depending on the color of ball pocketed. For each set of balls (known as a \\\\textit{frame}) one player has the first shot and continues to play until they fail to pocket a ball, at which point their competitor then has their own attempt. The number of points scored by a player in a single visit to the table is known as a \\\\textit{break}. The player who has the most points after all balls have been pocketed (or the other player concedes) is the winner of the frame\\n\\nSummarize the preceding context in 8 sentences.

Annihilation through two photons is \\nsuppressed by a factor of $\\\\alpha^2$, where $\\\\alpha$ is the fine structure \\nconstant. The only observed process of the two-photon annihilation into \\nhadrons in $e^+e^-$ collisions is the production of two vector mesons, \\n$\\\\rho^0\\\\rho^0$ and $\\\\rho^0\\\\phi$, in the BABAR experiment~\\\\cite{babar}. \\nExperiments on the search for production of a single $C$-even resonance \\nbegan more than 30 years ago at the VEPP-2M $e^+e^-$ collider with the ND \\ndetector\\\\cite{ND}. In these experiments, the first upper limits were set on \\nthe probabilities of the inverse reactions, namely the decays $\\\\eta'$, \\n$f_0(975)$, $f_2(1270)$, $f_0(1300)$, \\n$a_0(980)$, and $a_2(1320)$ to $e^+e^-$ pairs. In recent experiments at \\nthe colliders VEPP-2M~\\\\cite{ND,SND1}, VEPP-2000~\\\\cite{SND2,SND3}\\nand BEPCII~\\\\cite{bes}, this inverse-reaction technique was used to set \\nthe best upper limits on the electron widths of the resonances listed above,\\nas well as $\\\\eta$ and $X(3872)$. \\n\\\\begin{figure}[htbp]\\n\\\\centering\\n\\\\includegraphics[width=0.65\\\\textwidth]{fig1}\\n\\\\caption{ \\\\label{fig1}\\nThe diagram for the process $e^+e^-\\\\to f_1$.}\\n\\\\end{figure}\\n\\nIn this paper, we present the first search for the process \\n$e^+e^-\\\\to f_1(1285)$ shown in the diagram in Fig.~\\\\ref{fig1}. \\nThere are also no data on the $f_1(1285)\\\\to e^+e^-$ decay. \\nAxial-vector resonances, like the $f_1(1285)$, do not decay\\ninto two photons, but may nevertheless be produced in $e^+e^-$ annihilation,\\nthrough virtual photons. Theoretically, the $f_1(1285)\\\\to e^+e^-$ decay,\\nas well as the $e^+e^-\\\\to f_1(1285)$ process, are discussed in \\nRef.~\\\\cite{rudenko1,rudenko2} within the framework of the \\nvector-meson-dominance model\\nassuming that the virtual photons in Fig.~\\\\ref{fig1} are coupled with the \\n$f_1$ meson via intermediate $\\\\rho^0$ mesons.

       " \"\\\\section{Introduction}\\nImitation learning (IL), which tries to mimic the expert's behaviors, has been successfully applied to many tasks, \\\\emph{e.g.}, self-driving \\\\cite{bojarski2016end,li2017infogail}, navigation \\\\cite{silver2008high}, and robot locomotion \\\\cite{merel2017learning}. According to the information contained within the expert references, imitation learning can be divided into two categories, Learning from Demonstration (LfD) and Learning from Observation (LfO) \\\\cite{goo2019one,wake2020learning}. Specifically, the only difference between LfD and LfO is the required input data, \\\\emph{i.e.}, the former demands both states and actions while the latter only needs states. \\n\\nIntuitively, without actions from the expert, it would be more challenging to duplicate behaviors in the imitation learning scenario. However, motivations for LfO are comparatively strong: (1) it is infeasible to record actions in various practical scenarios. For example, in the robot locomotion task, we often desire robots to clone human behaviors. However, it is significantly difficult for us to obtain human actions (\\\\emph{e.g.}, the forces and torques acting on the joints and actuators \\\\cite{peng2018deepmimic,wang2019imitation,park2019learning}). In these cases, LfD is impracticable due to the absence of human actions. By contrast, LfO could still work effectively by exploiting massive online videos \\\\cite{peng2018sfv}; (2) it is quite unnatural to conduct imitation learning using actions as the guidance. Intelligent creatures primarily learn skills by observing how others accomplish tasks \\\\cite{douglas2006observational}. \\nThus, exploiting clues from actions in imitation learning would somewhat limit the intelligence of agents to a comparatively low level; (3) directly imitating actions is infeasible in situations where the expert and the learner are executing tasks in different environment dynamics \\\\cite{Gangwani2020State-only}\\n\\nSummarize the preceding context in 5 sentences.

       " 'On Friday, three cyber-security firms have come forward with reports or statements that link the NotPetya ransomware outbreak to a cyber-espionage group known for a large number of past cyber-attacks, such as the one on Ukraine\\'s power grid in December 2015.\\n\\nThe group behind all these attacks has been active since 2007 and is tracked under different names, such as Sandworm, BlackEnergy, and most recently as TeleBots, while other lesser known names include Electrum, TEMP.Noble, and Quedagh.\\n\\nGroup has a long history of hacking\\n\\nDespite becoming famous for using a Windows zero-day (CVE-2014-4114) against NATO and government organizations in 2014, the group is mainly known for two things: attacks on industrial infrastructure and their recent focus on Ukraine.\\n\\nThe group usually targets networks with SCADA equipment [1, 2] via a malware strain named BlackEnergy (v1, v2, and v3 - deployed since 2007).\\n\\nWhile the group initially went after targets all over the globe, in 2014, the group started focusing most of its operations against Ukraine, shortly after Russia occupied the Crimean Peninsula [1].\\n\\nIts most infamous attack remains the power blackout caused across western Ukraine around Christmas 2015 [1, 2]. While this attack gained the most media attention, the group also targeted the country\\'s airports, media organizations, banks, railroad, and mining companies, in wave after wave of attacks [1, 2, 3].\\n\\nThe BlackEnergy malware was used against industrial targets, but for attacks on other organizations, the group relied on social engineering, spear-phishing, and macro malware.\\n\\nGroup previously developed KillDisk wiper (fake ransomware)\\n\\nOne distinctive malware associated with this group is KillDisk. This is malware designed to destroy infected computers, meant to allow for industrial sabotage or covering the tracks of a cyber-attack. The group has long used this tool to attack its targets, but attacks with KillDisk ramped up this past winter.\\n\\nAccording to various reports, in December 2016, researchers reported seeing new versions of the KillDisk malware that came with a ransomware component, allowing it to \"pass\" as a ransomware infection.\\n\\nInitial versions of this KillDisk ransomware component were crude and didn\\'t even ask for a ransom, only showing an image from the Mr.Robot TV show.\\n\\nPicture displayed by KillDisk component [Source: ESET]\\n\\nLater, the group updated the KillDisk ransomware component with a ransom note but requested an absurd amount of money from victims (222 Bitcoin, or around $215,000 at the time). This huge ransom demand indicates that the group was never interested in money or expected victims to pay, something that researchers also said about NotPetya.\\n\\nKillDisk ransom note [Source: CyberX]\\n\\nLater, the same KillDisk malware was also ported to Linux. Most of these KillDisk attacks where the ransomware component was deployed were at Ukrainian banks and sea transportation companies, consistent with the group\\'s agenda of focusing attacks on Ukrainian targets.\\n\\nNotPetya, XData, BlackEnergy, & Sandworm are all connected\\n\\nIn a report released on Friday, ESET researcher Anton Cherepanov says his company discovered evidence that the group is behind many of the recent custom-made ransomware families that have targeted Ukraine,\\n\\nThe TeleBots attribution is based on infrastructure, used malicious tools, similar attack patterns and victim targeting — Anton Cherepanov (@cherepanov74) July 1, 2017\\n\\nShared infrastructure and TTPS (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) reveal a connection between past TeleBots/BlackEnergy/Sandworm operations and three ransomware outbreaks such as Win32/Filecoder.NKH (March 2017), XData (May 2017), and NotPetya (June 2017).\\n\\nAll three ransomware outbreaks, including the recent NotPetya attacks, Cherepanov says were specifically aimed at Ukrainian targets, consistent with the group\\'s past targeting, appearing to be part of a larger campaign aimed at sabotaging Ukraine\\'s business sector.\\n\\nIn a similar report also released on Friday, Kaspersky Lab also points out to the same connections between TeleBots/BlackEnergy/Sandworm past attacks and the NotPetya ransomware outbreak.\\n\\nNonetheless, unlike ESET, Kaspersky says its findings have a marking of \"low confidence,\" and shouldn\\'t be taken as definitive proof just yet.\\n\\nGroup linked to Russia in the past\\n\\nIn the past, various cyber-security firms have linked the TeleBots/BlackEnergy/Sandworm group to Russian cyber-espionage operations.\\n\\nHowever, neither ESET or Kaspersky have gone on record to blame the recent NotPetya outbreak on Russia, only drawing links to a well-known APT — a term used to describe groups involved in nation-state hacking operations — hoping others would connect past clues and reach their own conclusions.\\n\\nOther have already done so. In a Financial Times article, John Watters, head of global cyber intelligence operations for FireEye, said he\\'s \"reasonably confident\" that Russia was behind the NotPetya outbreak.\\n\\nUkrainian officials have already gone on record and blamed the NotPetya incident on Russian security services. NATO didn\\'t name Russia, but it said that a \"state actor\" was behind the attacks\\n\\nSummarize the preceding context in 5 sentences.

       " 'Helicases are enzymes that are best known for unwinding the DNA double helix in preparation for it to be replicated. These helicases, which consist of six protein subunits that form a closed ring, work by sliding along one strand of the DNA molecule. Other helicases function as single subunits. These monomeric helicases, which also work by sliding along DNA or RNA molecules, perform many other functions in cells. To date, there are many aspects of these monomeric helicases that remain poorly understood, including how they specialize to perform different tasks within a cell.\\n\\nNow, in eLife, Taekjip Ha and co-workers at the University of Illinois in Urbana Champaign and Princeton University—including Ruobo Zhou as the first author—have used biophysical techniques to investigate the Pif1 helicase from budding yeast (Zhou et al., 2014). Pif1 is the representative member of a family of monomeric helicases that are conserved from bacteria to humans. Pif1 is ‘a jack of all trades’: it inhibits enzymes that extend the ends of chromosomes (Boule et al., 2005); it helps to link fragments of newly copied DNA (Okazaki fragments) into a continuous strand (Boule and Zakian, 2006; Bochman et al., 2010); and it helps to swap genetic material between chromosomes (Wilson et al., 2013). Pif1 is also thought to prevent the DNA replication machinery from becoming stalled by DNA structures called ‘G-quadruplexes’ (Paeschke et al., 2011, 2013).\\n\\nTo monitor the activity of individual molecules of Pif1, Zhou et al. designed double-stranded DNA molecules with a single-stranded overhang at one end, and used a technique called Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET for short; Roy et al., 2008) to follow how the distance between the two ends of the overhang changed with time (Figure 1). These single-molecule FRET experiments revealed that the Pif1 monomer bound to the junction between the single-stranded and double-stranded DNA, and that it repeatedly ‘reeled in’ the single-stranded overhang, most likely in one-base steps (Figure 1A). Zhou et al. called this activity ‘patrolling’ and showed that an individual Pif1 molecule could complete hundreds of rounds of patrolling (which showed that it was very stably anchored to the junction).\\n\\nFigure 1 Download asset Open asset Pif1 patrolling and its diverse genome-maintenance tasks. (A) Experimental set-up of the single-molecule experiments in Zhou et al. A helicase substrate consisting of a short DNA double helix (red and blue) with a 3′ overhang (blue) was attached to a glass coverslip (grey). A technique called FRET was used to monitor how the distance between the two ends of the overhang changed over time: this involved adding two organic dyes, a donor (green star) and an acceptor (orange star), to the ends of the overhang and recording how the amount of light emitted by the donor and the acceptor changed with time. Zhou et al. found that Pif1 anchored itself to the junction between the double-stranded DNA and the overhang, and periodically patrolled the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) overhang by repeatedly reeling it in and forming loops\\n\\nSummarize the preceding context in 7 sentences.

It missed that deadline, but now it is up and running, available as both a pure web-based service and as a tiny set-top box for those without a PC at all.\\n\\nOnce you log on, you get a Cooliris type display that allows you to pick a game to demo or pay for. I didn’t buy any games and instead chose a FPS on a time limited preview to test out the system. FPS relies on low lag rates and fast reactive controls to be any fun, and I thought this would be best in trying out the system. There is barely any load time as when you click the screenshot of the game you want to play, it enlarges and after about 5 seconds the game is playable.\\n\\nIt works!\\n\\nWith all the heavy crunching done on Onlive’s servers in the US, the system demands on my laptop were only as much as playing an equivalent sizes video. Lag was not noticeable and the reactions to my key presses were as fast as if it was running on the machine in front of me. I was very impressed by the system and didn’t notice any drawbacks on the hardware/software at all, although there are some things to take into account.\\n\\nThe drawbacks\\n\\nPayment has to be mentioned here. You can buy access to the game of your choice in a variety of flavours; a 3 day, 5 day or full play pass, which I think means you get to play the game for as long as the service exists. However, none of these options are particularly cheap though. Hawx 2, which is available for peanuts second-hand is $49.99. Patrician\\n\\nSummarize the preceding context in 6 sentences.

       " \"\\\\section{Introduction}\\n\\\\label{sect:intro} \\n\\nLast two years were a turning-point for the gravitational-wave (GW)\\nastrophysics. First direct detections of GWs from binary systems of massive\\nstellar black holes with the Advanced LIGO detectors (\\\\citealt{GW150914} and\\nsubsequent ones) demonstrated the viability of the detection principle using\\nthe kilometer-size laser interferometry. This state-of-the-art (Advanced LIGO\\n\\\\citealt{ALIGO2015} and Advanced Virgo \\\\citealt{AdV2015}) technology creates an\\nunprecedented opportunity for studying the Universe through a novel \\nchannel of spacetime distortion \\\\citep{Einstein1916}\\nmeasurements. For a mainstream astronomer, GW astronomy may seem a rather\\nnon-standard way of studying the Universe -- it is more like `listening to' than\\nsimply 'looking at' the skies. Motivated by the choice of potential\\nsources, the ground-based GW detectors of LIGO and Virgo are sensitive to the\\nrange of frequencies similar to the audible range of human ears -- between 10 Hz\\n(limited by the seismic noise) and a few kHz (limited by the quantum nature of\\nlaser light). As in the case of an ear, a solitary laser interferometer is\\npractically omnidirectional (has a poor angular resolution), and has no imaging\\ncapabilities; the localisation of sources is performed using a global network\\nof detectors, currently realized by the three detectors of the LIGO-Virgo\\nCollaboration.  \\n\\nGWs are created by a bulk movement of large, rapidly-moving masses: their accelerated\\nmovement provides a time-varying quadrupole, which is the lowest\\nradiating moment in the theory of general relativity (GR). \\nOnce emitted, GWs are\\nweakly coupled to the surrounding matter and propagate freely without\\nscattering. This has to be contrasted with the electromagnetic emission that\\noriginates at the microscopic level,  is strongly coupled to the surroundings\\nand often reprocessed; it carries a reliable information from the last\\nscattering surface only. GWs are therefore the perfect counterparts to the\\nelectromagnetic waves as they provide us with the information impossible to\\nobtain by other means. \\n\\nScience needed 100 years since the birth of GR \\\\citep{Einstein1915} to the\\nmoment when GWs are routinely directly registered by sophisticated apparatus on\\nthe Earth, and changing our understanding of the Universe. The Advanced LIGO\\nand Advanced Virgo detectors were build thanks by part to the {\\\\it indirect}\\nevidence gathered in early times of the development of the theory and\\nobservations. In contrary to the Newton's theory of gravity, in which the state\\nof moving masses does not evolve when no dissipation mechanisms are present, GR\\nhas the energy dissipation mechanism build-in into its very fabric. Early\\nseminal works of prof. Andrzej Trautman convincingly showed that GWs carry the\\nenergy away from the radiating system, and thus are real physical phenomena and\\nnot artifacts of coordinate choice \\\\citep{RobinsonT1960}. From the\\nobservational side, prof. Bohdan Paczyński demonstrated that extremely short\\norbital periods of binaries containing white dwarfs, WZ Sge and HZ29, are\\npossible only due to the emission of GWs \\\\citep{Paczynski1967}. \\nFull realization that binary systems do in fact evolve according to GR came with the\\ndiscoveries of binary neutron star systems in the 70s (for a summary see,\\ne.g., \\\\citealt{WeisbergT2005}). Every binary system emits GWs, leading to the\\ntightening of its orbit and increasing its orbital frequency, inevitably\\ndriving the components to merge\\n\\nSummarize the preceding context in 4 sentences.

Neither the armored vehicle nor the grenade launchers have ever been used. But the district doesn’t plan on keeping them.\\n\\n“It’s a piece of equipment that’s not essential for our mission, so we will be disposing of those,” Zipperman said.\\n\\nThe armored vehicles and heavy artillery distributed to local agencies became a national issue in the wake of the riots in Ferguson, Mo.\\n\\n“I can’t allow whatever political ramifications or analysis in Ferguson suggest how I want to make a decision on how to best make sure we respond at the LAUSD,” Zipperman said.\\n\\nThe chief says the armored vehicle will stay but will only be deployed on his direct orders with the approval of the school superintendent.\\n\\n“To suggest that it’s a threatening type of equipment or equipment for a show of force, that is not the case,” Zipperman said\\n\\nSummarize the preceding context in 8 sentences.

       " '\\n\\\\section{Introduction}\\n\\\\label{sec:introduction}\\nGiven a mixture of a speech signal co-occurring in a background of ambient noise, the goal of single-channel speech enhancement is to extract the speech signal in the given mixture. With recent advancements in Neural Networks~(NNs) and deep learning, several neural network based approaches have been proposed for single-channel speech enhancement~\\\\cite{xu2013experimental, weninger2015speech, pascual2017segan}. These networks and approaches are predominantly trained in a supervised manner. The noisy mixture signal is fed as an input to the NN. The NN is then trained to estimate the corresponding clean speech signal in the mixture at its output. Thus, to train NNs for supervised speech enhancement, we require access to a vast training set of paired examples of noisy mixtures and their corresponding clean speech versions. As a result, supervised learning approaches to speech enhancement and source separation suffer from the following drawbacks.\\n\\n\\\\begin{enumerate}\\n    \\\\setlength\\\\itemsep{0.1em}\\n\\n    \\\\item Clean targets can often be difficult or expensive to obtain. For example, bird calls recorded in a forest are often found to be in the presence of interfering sounds like the ones from animals, trees and thunderstorms. Alternatively, machine fault recordings are often taken when the machine is in operation to identify potential damages and it is infeasible to record these sounds in an isolated manner to obtain clean recorded versions. \\n    \\n    \\\\item These networks cannot be used as stand-alone learning machines that autonomously learn to denoise speech mixtures in ambient recording environments.\\n    \\n    \\\\item The trained speech enhancement systems can potentially be deployed in previously unseen conditions. Thus, there is a strong possibility of a mismatch between the training and test conditions. In such cases, we do not have the ability to use the recorded test mixtures to improve the performance of our model in the unseen test setting.\\n\\\\end{enumerate}\\n\\nTo relax the constraints of paired training data, a few recent approaches interpret the problem of denoising and source separation as a style-transfer problem wherein, the goal is to map from the domain of noisy mixtures to the domain of clean sounds~\\\\cite{stoller2018adversarial, michelashvili2019semi, venkataramani2019style}. These approaches only require a training set of mixtures and a training set of clean sounds, but the clean sounds can be unpaired and unrelated to the mixtures\\n\\nSummarize the preceding context in 5 sentences.

       " 'An order from Gen Mohammed Ali Jaafari, the commander of the guards, raised the operational readiness status of the country’s forces, initiating preparations for potential external strikes and covert attacks.\\n\\nWestern intelligence officials said the Islamic Republic had initiated plans to disperse long-range missiles, high explosives, artillery and guards units to key defensive positions.\\n\\nThe order was given in response to the mounting international pressure over Iran’s nuclear programme. Preparation for a confrontation has gathered pace following last month’s report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Vienna that produced evidence that Iran was actively working to produce nuclear weapons.\\n\\nThe Iranian leadership fears the country is being subjected to a carefully co-ordinated attack by Western intelligence and security agencies to destroy key elements of its nuclear infrastructure.\\n\\nRecent explosions have added to the growing sense of paranoia within Iran, with the regime fearing it will be the target of a surprise military strike by Israel or the US.\\n\\nIts ballistic missile programme suffered a major setback on Nov 12 after an explosion at the regime’s main missile testing facility at Bidganeh, about 30 miles west of Tehran.\\n\\nAt least 17 people died, including Gen Hassan Tehrani Moghaddam, the head of Iran’s missile research programme.\\n\\nThe IAEA report said Iranian scientists had worked to develop a missile capable of carrying nuclear warheads. Security analysts described Iran’s missile advances as “a turning point” that had “profound strategic implications”.\\n\\nLast week another mysterious explosion caused significant damage to Iran’s uranium conversion facility at Isfahan.\\n\\n“It looks like the 21st century form of war,” said Patrick Clawson of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, a Washington think tank, told the Los Angeles Times. “It does appear that there is a campaign of assassinations and cyber war, as well as the semi-acknowledged campaign of sabotage.”\\n\\nAyatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s spiritual leader, issued a directive to the heads of all the country’s military, intelligence and security organisations to take all necessary measures to protect the regime.\\n\\nGen Jaafari responded to this directive by ordering Revolutionary Guards units to redistribute Iran’s arsenal of long-range Shahab missiles to secret sites around the country where they would be safe from enemy attack and could be used to launch retaliatory attacks.\\n\\nIn addition, the Iranian air force has formed a number of “rapid reaction units”, which have been carrying out extensive exercises to practice a response to an enemy air attack.\\n\\nAt the weekend, Iran claimed it had succeeded in shooting down an advanced American RQ-170 drone in the east of the country. If true, this would represent a major coup for the ayatollahs, as this type of drone contains sensitive stealth technology that allows it to operate for hours without being detected.\\n\\nA spokesman for Nato’s International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan would only confirm that US operators had “lost control” of a drone, without specifying the model.\\n\\nIntelligence officials believe the dangerous game of cat and mouse between Iran and the West was responsible for last week’s attack on the British Embassy in Tehran. William Hague, the Foreign Secretary, closed the embassy and expelled Iranian diplomats in response.\\n\\nBut with Iran showing no sign of backing down over its nuclear programme, there is growing concern that Israel will launch unilateral military action.\\n\\nAt the weekend, Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, warned that he would take “the right decision at the right moment” if Iran continued with its uranium enrichment programme.\\n\\nIsrael’s uncompromising approach is viewed with alarm in Washington.\\n\\nLeon Panetta, the US defence secretary, has warned that a unilateral strike by Israel risked “an escalation” that could “consume the Middle East in confrontation and conflict that we would regret”\\n\\nSummarize the preceding context in 5 sentences.

       " 'Why Bogus Therapies Seem to Work\\n\\nAt least ten kinds of errors and biases can convince intelligent, honest people that cures have been achieved when they have not.\\n\\n“Nothing is more dangerous than active ignorance.” —Goethe\\n\\nThose who sell therapies of any kind have an obligation to prove, first, that their treatments are safe and, second, that they are effective. The latter is often the more difficult task because there are many subtle ways that honest and intelligent people (both patients and therapists) can be led to think that a treatment has cured someone when it has not. This is true whether we are assessing new treatments in scientific medicine, old nostrums in folk medicine, fringe treatments in “alternative medicine,” or the frankly magical panaceas of faith healers.\\n\\nTo distinguish causal from fortuitous improvements that might follow any intervention, a set of objective procedures has evolved for testing putative remedies. Unless a technique, ritual, drug, or surgical procedure can meet these requirements, it is ethically questionable to offer it to the public, especially if money is to change hands. Since most “alternative” therapies (i.e., ones not accepted by scientific biomedicine) fall into this category, one must ask why so many customers who would not purchase a toaster without consulting Consumer Reports shell out, with trusting naivetë, large sums for unproven, possibly dangerous, health remedies.\\n\\nFor many years, critics have been raising telling doubts about fringe medical practices, but the popularity of such nostrums seems undiminished. We must wonder why entrepreneurs’ claims in this area should remain so refractory to contrary data. If an “alternative” or “complementary” therapy:\\n\\nis implausible on a priori grounds (because its implied mechanisms or putative effects contradict well-established laws, principles, or empirical findings in physics, chemistry, or biology), lacks a scientifically acceptable rationale of its own, has insufficient supporting evidence derived from adequately controlled outcome research (i.e., double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials), has failed in well-controlled clinical studies done by impartial evaluators and has been unable to rule out competing explanations for why it might seem to work in uncontrolled settings, and, should seem improbable, even to the lay person, on “commonsense” grounds, why would so many well-educated people continue to sell and purchase such a treatment?\\n\\nThe answer, I believe, lies in a combination of vigorous marketing of unsubstantiated claims by “alternative” healers (Beyerstein and Sampson 1996), the poor level of scientific knowledge in the public at large (Kiernan 1995), and the “will to believe” so prevalent among seekers attracted to the New Age movement (Basil 1988; Gross and Levitt 1994).\\n\\nThe appeal of nonscientific medicine is largely a holdover from popular “counterculture” sentiments of the 1960s and 1970s. Remnants of the rebellious, “back-to-nature” leanings of that era survive as nostalgic yearnings for a return to nineteenth-century-style democratized health care (now wrapped in the banner of patients’ rights) and a dislike of bureaucratic, technologic, and specialized treatment of disease (Cassileth and Brown 1988). Likewise, the allure of the “holistic” dogmas of alternative medicine is a descendant of the fascination with Eastern mysticism that emerged in the sixties and seventies. Although the philosophy and the science that underlie these holistic teachings have been severely criticized (Brandon 1985), they retain a strong appeal for those committed to belief in “mind-over-matter” cures, a systemic rather than localized view of pathology, and the all-powerful ability of nutrition to restore health (conceived of as whole-body “balance”).\\n\\nMany dubious health products remain on the market primarily because satisfied customers offer testimonials to their worth. Essentially, they are saying, “I tried it and I got better, so it must be effective.” But even when symptoms do improve following a treatment, this, by itself, cannot prove that the therapy was responsible.\\n\\nThe Illness-Disease Distinction\\n\\nAlthough the terms disease and illness are often used interchangeably, for present purposes it is worth distinguishing between the two\\n\\nSummarize the preceding context in 8 sentences.

For these we can compare against two state-of-the-art algorithms, both probabilistic generative models but different in their assumptions: \\\\mbox{{\\\\small CESNA}} \\\\cite{yang2013community} which considers overlapping communities and posits two independent Bernoulli distributions for network edges and node attributes; and  the model proposed by Newman and Clauset \\\\cite{newman2016structure} (\\\\mbox{{\\\\small NC}}) for non-overlapping communities, a Bayesian approach where the priors on the community memberships depend on the node attributes. \\\\mbox{{\\\\small CESNA}},  similarly to our model, assumes conditional independence of the two likelihoods and introduces a regularization parameter between them; it uses block-coordinate ascent for parameters' estimation, while \\\\mbox{{\\\\small NC}}\\\\text{} uses an EM algorithm for parameters' estimation, similarly to what we do here. We test \\\\mbox{{\\\\small MTCOV}}\\\\text{} against them on both synthetic and real single-layer networks with node attributes, with and without ground-truth. We transform directed networks to undirected because both \\\\mbox{{\\\\small CESNA}}\\\\text{} and \\\\mbox{{\\\\small NC}}\\\\text{} do not distinguish for edge directionality. Results on synthetic data show that \\\\mbox{{\\\\small MTCOV}}\\\\text{} and \\\\mbox{{\\\\small NC}}\\\\text{} have similar performance in correctly classifying nodes in their ground-truth communities and both are better than \\\\mbox{{\\\\small CESNA}}; the main difference is that \\\\mbox{{\\\\small MTCOV}}\\\\text{} is more stable and has less variance for high attribute correlation,  in particular in the hard regime where classification is more difficult. We leave details in the Supplementary Section S3.  \\nFor single-layer real networks, we use datasets with ground-truth candidates and node attributes: the ego-Facebook network\\\\cite{facebook} (\\\\textit{facebook}), a set of 21 networks built from connections between a person's friends where potential ground-truth are circles of friends hand-labeled by the ego herself; the American College football network (\\\\textit{football}) \\\\cite{football}, a network of football teams playing against each other, where a ground-truth candidate is the conference to which each team belongs; and a network of political blogs \\\\cite{polblogs} (\\\\textit{polblogs}) where potential ground-truth communities are divided by \\\\textit{left/liberal} and \\\\textit{right/conservative} political parties, see Supplementary Section S3 for details. For each network, we run a 5-fold cross-validation procedure combined with grid-search for fixing the hyperparameter $\\\\gamma$. For \\\\textit{facebook} we find that the average over the 21 networks is $\\\\gamma=0.15$, which signals a low correlation between the covariates and the communities, whereas for the \\\\textit{football} and \\\\textit{polblogs} networks we obtain much higher values of $\\\\gamma$ equal to $0.6$ and  $0.75$ respectively. \\\\mbox{{\\\\small MTCOV}}\\\\text{} has better performance in terms of F1-score and Jaccard similarity across the majority of datasets, as shown in Table \\\\ref{tab: single-layer}. This is also supported by a trial-by-trial comparison shown in Fig. \\\\ref{fig: single-layer1} for F1-score (similar results are obtained for Jaccard), where we find that \\\\mbox{{\\\\small MTCOV}}\\\\text{}  is more accurate in $59\\\\%$ and $90\\\\%$ of the cases than \\\\mbox{{\\\\small NC}}\\\\text{} and \\\\mbox{{\\\\small CESNA}}, respectively.\\n\\n\\\\begin{table}[]\\n\\\\centering\\n\\\\renewcommand{\\\\arraystretch}{1.2}\\n{\\\\begin{tabular}{lccc|ccc}\\n\\\\clineB{1-7}{3}\\n\\\\multicolumn{1}{c}{\\\\textbf{}}        & \\\\multicolumn{3}{c|}{\\\\textbf{F1-score}}                                        & \\\\multicolumn{3}{c}{\\\\textbf{Jaccard similarity}}    \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\multicolumn{1}{l|}{\\\\textbf{Method}} & \\\\textbf{facebook}           & \\\\textbf{football}           & \\\\textbf{polblogs} & \\\\textbf{facebook}           & \\\\textbf{football}           & \\\\textbf{polblogs}  \\\\\\\\ \\\\hline\\n\\\\multicolumn{1}{l|}{\\\\mbox{{\\\\small MTCOV}} }           & \\\\textbf{0.5$\\\\pm$0\\n\\nSummarize the preceding context in 6 sentences.

The nuclear X-ray source is generally thought to be even more \\ncompact than the Broad Line Region (BLR) and hence provides a\\ngeometrically simple (when viewed from afar) emission region right \\nat the heart of the Seyfert. X-rays are photoelectrically \\nabsorbed by neutral atomic gas \\nand molecular gas in essentially the same manner, and most \\ndust grains absorb X-rays as would an equivalent amount of \\nneutral gas. Highly ionized gas can also be effectively probed\\nby means of oxygen and other X-ray absorption edges. \\nIn this paper, we use 0.6--9.5~keV spectra provided by the\\nJapan/USA {\\\\it Advanced Satellite for Cosmology and Astrophysics}\\n({\\\\it ASCA\\\\/}; see Tanaka, Inoue \\\\& Holt 1994) to \\nperform the first detailed study of the  \\nX-ray emission and absorption properties of \\nMarkarian~6 (IC~450; \\n$V \\\\approx 14.2$, see Weedman 1972; \\n$V_0=5784\\\\pm 10$~km~s$^{-1}$,\\nsee Meaburn, Whitehead \\\\& Pedlar 1989). \\nWe also present results from nearly simultaneous optical spectroscopy. \\nMrk~6 is an S0 galaxy that contains a Seyfert \\nnucleus of type~1.5 (e.g. Osterbrock \\\\& Koski 1976 and references \\ntherein).

The curvature dimension inequalities are defined by the $\\\\Gamma$-calculation. To define $\\\\Gamma$-calculation on graphs, we need the symmetric graph laplacian. In general, the graph laplacian is defined using an adjacent matrix. Jost-Liu \\\\cite{Jo2} defined the curvature dimension inequalities on finite undirected graphs, and found relations between Ricci curvature and $CD(m, K)$ . However, an adjacent matrix of directed graphs is usually asymmetry, so the graph laplacian is also asymmetry. \\n On the other hand, there is an another definition of the graph laplacian by Chung \\\\cite{Chung}. He defined the graph laplacian by using the transition probability matrix, and symmetrized it.\\\\\\\\\\n \\u3000We have defined Ricci curvature on directed graphs \\\\cite{Yamada}. So, we define the curvature dimension inequalities on finite directed graphs, and find specific $m$ and $K$ in this paper.\\n \\\\section{Curvature dimension inequalities on directed graphs}\\n  Throughout the paper, let $G=(V, E)$ be a directed graph. For $x, y \\\\in V$, we write $(x, y)$ as an edge from $x$ to $y$ if any.  We denote the set of vertices of $G$ by $V(G)$ and the set of edges by $E(G)$.\\n  \\\\begin{definition}\\n  (1) A {\\\\em path} from vertex $x$ to vertex $y$ is a sequence of edges\\\\\\\\ $(x, a_{1}), (a_{1}, a_{2}), \\\\cdots ,(a_{n-2}, a_{n-1}), (a_{n-1}, y)$, where $n \\\\geq 1$. We call $n$ the {\\\\em length} of the path.\\\\\\\\\\n  (2) The {\\\\em distance} $d(x, y)$ between two vertices $x, y \\\\in V$ is the length of a shortest path connecting them.\\n  \\\\end{definition}\\n  \\\\begin{remark}\\n  The distance function has positivity and triangle inequality, but symmetry is not necessarily satisfied.\\n  \\\\end{remark}\\n    \\\\begin{definition}\\n  (1) For any $x \\\\in V$, the {\\\\em out-neighborhood} ({\\\\em in-neighborhood}) of $x$ is defined as\\n   \\\\begin{eqnarray*}\\n    S^{\\\\mathrm{out}}(x) := \\\\left\\\\{y \\\\in V \\\\mid (x, y) \\\\in E \\\\right\\\\}\\\\ (S^{\\\\mathrm{in}}(x) := \\\\left\\\\{z \\\\in V \\\\mid (z, x) \\\\in E \\\\right\\\\}).\\n   \\\\end{eqnarray*}\\n  (2) For all $x \\\\in V$, \\n   The {\\\\em degree} of $x$, denoted by $d_{x}$, is the number of edges from $x$. i.e., $d_{x} = |S^{\\\\mathrm{out}}(x)|$.\\n    \\\\end{definition}\\n    We sometimes use the following notation.\\n  \\\\begin{eqnarray*}\\n\\tN^{\\\\mathrm{out}}(x) := \\\\left\\\\{ x \\\\right\\\\} \\\\cup S^{\\\\mathrm{out}}(x)\\\\\\n\\t(N^{\\\\mathrm{in}}(x) := \\\\left\\\\{ x \\\\right\\\\} \\\\cup S^{\\\\mathrm{in}}(x)).\\n  \\\\end{eqnarray*}  \\n  \\\\begin{definition}\\n  A {\\\\em probability matrix} $M_{\\\\alpha}$ is defined by the following.\\n\\\\begin{eqnarray*}\\n(M_{\\\\alpha})_{i, j} = m^{\\\\alpha}_{v_{i}}(v_{j}) :=\\\\begin{cases}\\n \\\\displaystyle \\\\alpha,& v_{j} = v_{i}, \\\\\\\\\\n \\\\displaystyle \\\\frac{1 - \\\\alpha}{d_{v_{i}}},& (v_{i}, v_{j}) \\\\in E(G), \\\\\\\\\\n 0,& \\\\mathrm{\\\\mathrm{otherwise}},\\n\\\\end{cases}\\n\\\\end{eqnarray*}\\nwhere $\\\\alpha \\\\in [0, 1)$ and $(M_{\\\\alpha})_{i, j}$ is an $(i, j)$-element of $M_{\\\\alpha}$\\n\\nSummarize the preceding context in 5 sentences.

       " '\\\\section{Introduction}\\nTwo gravitational wave signals GW150914~\\\\cite{Ligo} and  GW151226~\\\\cite{GW151226} generated by black hole merging systems were detected recently  by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory. This confirms  directly  a prediction of Einstein based on his classical theory of general relativity~\\\\cite{Einstein} regarding the existence of  gravitational waves which are spacetime ripples propagating through the universe.  Quantum mechanically, gravitational interaction is presumably mediated by gravitons when gravity is quantized.  However, a full theory of quantum gravity is elusive at the present.  Even though, general relativity as  an effective field theory provides  a framework to probe the low  energy quantum gavity effects. In this respect, it has been found that there exists a quantum correction to the Newtonian  force between two mass monopoles which behaves as $r^{-3}$~\\\\cite{Donoghue}, and this  is obtained by summing one-loop Feynman diagrams with off-shell gravitons.  \\n\\nRecently, the quantum gravity correction to classical forces  was extended to include the quadrupole-quadrupole interaction  between a pair of polarizable objects from their induced quadrupole moments due to two-graviton exchange~\\\\cite{Ford16}.  This correction is computed by first finding out the normal field modes which keep the cycle in phase in which at the outset one object is polarized and radiates a gravitational field which polarizes the second and induces a quadrupole of which the gravitational field in return polarizes the first, and then summing up the zero-point energy of  all these normal  modes to get the interaction potential between two quadrupoles. This  is in close analogy to that in the computation  of  the Casimir-Polder and van der Waals (vdW) forces between a pair of atoms from their induced dipole moments due to two photon exchange~\\\\cite{Sernelius}. An advantage of  this method is that  the details of quantization of the gravitational metric are not needed.  \\n\\n  Although a full theory of quantum gravity is  absent, one can still use linearized quantum gravity to find quantum gravitational corrections to classical physics which an ultimate quantum gravity theory must produce at low energies. One such example is the quantum light-cone fluctuations produced by gravitons propagating on a background spacetime~\\\\cite{Yu99, Yu00, Yu09}.  When gravity is quantized, there inevitably exist quantum gravitational fluctuations which induce quadrupoles in gravitationally polarizable  objects, thus giving rise to a quantum correction to the classical interaction between polarizable objects. In this paper, we present in the framework of linearized quantum gravity a different field-theoretic  approach to the computation of the quantum gravity correction to the classical gravitational interaction between a pair of polarizable objects. \\n Our approach, which  is  parallel to that used by Casimir and Polder in studying  the quantum electromagnetic vacuum fluctuation induced electric dipole-dipole interaction between two neutral atoms in a quantum theory of electromagnetism~\\\\cite{Casimir}, is based upon the leading-order perturbation theory.   Let us note that a rather simple perturbative calculation of   both the retarded and instantaneous electromagnetic interaction can also be found in~\\\\cite{Holstein2001}. \\n\\n\\nThe  system we consider consists of two  gravitationally polarizable objects  in a bath of fluctuating quantum gravitational fields in vacuum.  We assume that the two  objects labeled as $A$ and $B$ can be treated as  two-level harmonic oscillators. Then, the total Hamiltonian can be give by\\n\\\\bea{H}\\nH=H_{F} + H_{A}+H_{B}+H_{AF} +H_{BF}\\\\ ,\\n\\\\end{eqnarray}\\nwhere $H_{F}$ is the Hamiltonian of gravitational fields, the  Hamiltonian of the object $H_{A(B)}$ takes the form\\n\\\\bea{}\\nH_{A(B)}=E_{A(B)}^{0} |0_{A(B)}\\\\rangle\\\\langle 0_{A(B)}|+E_{A(B)}^{1} |1_{A(B)}\\\\rangle\\\\langle 1_{A(B)}|\\\\ ,\\n\\\\end{eqnarray}\\nand $H_{A(B)F}$   represents the interactions between the objects and gravitational fields \\n\\\\bea{HA}\\n{H}_{A(B)F}=-\\\\frac{1}{2}  {Q}_{A(B)}^{ij}  {E}_{ij}\\\\;.\\n\\\\end{eqnarray}\\nHere the Einstein convention is assumed for repeated indices, Latin indices run from 1 to 3,    $ {Q}_{ij}$ is the gravitational vacuum fluctuation induced quadrupole moment of the object and $E_{ij}=R_{0i0j}$ is the gravito-electric tensor with $R_{\\\\mu\\\\nu\\\\alpha\\\\beta}$ being  the Riemann tensor.  $E_{ij}$, which is defined by an analogy between the linearized Einstein field equations and the Maxwell equations~\\\\cite{Campbell},  determines the tidal gravitational acceleration  between two nearby test particles in the classical Newtonian gravity. \\nFor a flat background spacetime with a linearized perturbation $h_{\\\\mu\\\\nu}$ propagating upon it, the metric can be expanded as  $g_{\\\\mu\\\\nu}=\\\\eta_{\\\\mu\\\\nu}+h_{\\\\mu\\\\nu}$. From the definition of $E_{ij}$ one can obtain \\n\\\\bea{Eij}\\nE_{ij}=\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\ddot{h}_{ij}\\\\;,\\n\\\\end{eqnarray}\\nwhere a dot denotes a derivative with respect to time $t$.\\n\\nIn the transverse tracefree (TT) gauge, the gravitational field can be quantized as~\\\\cite{Yu99} \\n\\\\bea{hij}\\nh_{ij}({\\\\bf r}, t)=\\\\sum_{{\\\\bf k}, \\\\lambda}[a_{\\\\lambda}(\\\\omega, {\\\\bf r}) e_{ij}({\\\\bf k}, \\\\lambda) f_{{\\\\bf k}}+H\\n\\nSummarize the preceding context in 8 sentences.

       " '\\\\section{Introduction}\\n\\tPerson re-identification (ReID) is an important task that matches person images across times/spaces/cameras, which has many applications such as people tracking in smart retail, image retrieval for finding lost children. Existing approaches achieve remarkable performance when the training and testing data are from the same dataset/domain. But they usually fail to generalize well to other datasets where there are domain gaps~\\\\cite{ge2020mutual}. To address this practical problem, unsupervised domain adaptive (UDA) person ReID attracts much attention for both the academic and industrial communities, where labeled source domain and unlabeled target domain data are exploited for training.\\n\\n\\tTypical UDA person ReID approaches~\\\\cite{ge2020mutual,zhai2020adcluster,zhong2019invariance,2020Hierarchical,song2020unsupervised} include three steps: feature pre-training with labeled source domain data, clustering-based pseudo-label prediction for the target domain data, and feature representation learning/fine-tuning with the pseudo-labels. The last two steps are usually iteratively conducted to promote each other. However, the pseudo-labels obtained/assigned through clustering usually contain noisy (wrong) labels due to the divergence/domain gap between the source and target data, and the imperfect results of the clustering algorithm. Such noisy labels would mislead the feature learning and harm the domain adaptation performance. Thus, \\\\emph{alleviating the negative effects of those samples with unreliable/noisy pseudo labels is important for the success of domain adaptation}.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tThe challenge lies in 1) how to identify samples that are prone to have noisy pseudo labels; 2) how to alleviate their negative effects during the optimization. In this paper, to answer the first question, we have observed abundant samples and analyzed the relationship between the characteristics of the samples and the correctness of pseudo labels. Based on the theory on uncertainty~\\\\cite{kendall2017uncertainties}, a model has uncertainty on its prediction of an input sample. Here, we measure the inconsistency level of the output features of two models (the student model and the teacher model based on the mean teacher method~\\\\cite{tarvainen2017mean}) and take it as the estimated uncertainty of a target domain sample. \\\\textcolor{black}{As shown in Fig.~\\\\ref{fig:intro}, we observe the distribution of the uncertainty (inconsistency levels) for correct/clean pseudo labels and wrong pseudo labels. We found that the uncertainty values for the samples with wrong pseudo labels are usually larger} than those with correct pseudo labels. This motivates us to estimate and exploit the uncertainty of samples to alleviate the negative effects of noisy pseudo labels, enabling effective domain adaptation. We answer the second question by carefully incorporating the uncertainty of samples into classification loss, triplet loss, and contrastive loss, respectively.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tWe summarize our main contributions as follows:\\n\\n\\\\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,noitemsep,nolistsep]\\n\\n\\\\item  We propose a network named Uncertainty-guided Noise Resilient Network (UNRN) to explore the credibility of the predicted pseudo labels of target domain samples for effective domain adaptive person ReID.\\n\\n\\\\item  We develop an uncertainty estimation strategy by calculating the inconsistency of two models in terms of their predicted soft multilabels\\n\\nSummarize the preceding context in 7 sentences.

In the uniformly hyperbolic setting, if $G$ is continuous then there is an equilibrium state and if $G$ is H\\\\\"older then the equilibrium state is unique. The existence is a consequence of the map $\\\\mu \\\\mapsto h(\\\\mu)$ being upper semi-continuous when the diffeomorphism is entropy expansive \\\\cite{Bowen}. The uniqueness is a consequence of the specification property \\\\cite{Bowen unique}. In the partially hyperbolic setting this question is more difficult. Although we will construct equilibrium states in this article, we will not investigate their uniqueness (and indeed we would not expect uniqueness for all continuous potentials, $G$).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFundamental work due to Sinai and Pesin \\\\cite{ps} extends the notion of an SRB measure for uniformly hyperbolic attractors to u-Gibbs measures in the partially hyperbolic setting. For an exposition on u-Gibbs measures see (for example) \\\\cite{Dogo}. Intuitively u-Gibbs measures are defined to be absolutely continuous with respect to the induced volume on unstable manifolds with nice conditional densities. In \\\\cite{ps} the authors start with absolutely continuous reference measures on $W_\\\\delta^u$ (with a suitable density), then taking averaged pullbacks, the limiting measures are $f$-invariant u-Gibbs measures.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this article we consider varying measures supported on a piece of unstable manifold that are absolutely continuous with respect to the induced volume. In \\\\cite{PaPo} we replaced the induced measure on unstable leaves, $\\\\lambda$, by the integral with respect to $\\\\lambda$ over $W_\\\\delta^u(x)$ of specially chosen density functions. In this article we will apply similar methods as those in \\\\cite{PaPo} to the setting of partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms (although we require additional conditions that will be described below). Let $\\\\Phi : X \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{R}$ be the geometric potential defined by $\\\\Phi(x) = - \\\\log | $det$(Df|E_x^u)|$. This is usually called the unstable expansion coefficient, where $E_x^u$ is the unstable bundle for the diffeomorphism. Noting that partially hyperbolic attracting diffeomorphisms have local unstable leaves $W_\\\\delta^u(x)$ tangent to the unstable splitting and inherit volume measures then the following is our construction.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\\begin{thm}\\\\label{thm:gibbsdiffeo_intro}\\r\\nLet $f: X \\\\to X$ be a $C^{1+\\\\alpha}$ topologically mixing partially hyperbolic attracting diffeomorphism satisfying Lyapunov stability (Definition \\\\ref{LS}) and  let  $G: X \\\\to \\\\mathbb R$ be a continuous function.\\r\\nGiven $x\\\\in X$ and $\\\\delta > 0$ \\r\\nconsider \\r\\nthe  sequence of probability measures $(\\\\lambda_n)_{n=1}^\\\\infty$ \\r\\nsupported on $W^u_\\\\delta(x)$ \\r\\nand absolutely continuous with respect to the induced volume $\\\\lambda = \\\\lambda_{W^u_\\\\delta(x)}$\\r\\nwith densities\\r\\n$$\\r\\n\\\\frac{d\\\\lambda_n}{d\\\\lambda}(y) :=  \\r\\n\\\\frac{\\r\\n \\\\exp\\\\left( \\\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (G - \\\\Phi)(f^iy)) \\\\right) \\r\\n }{\\r\\n \\\\int_{W_\\\\delta^u(x)}\\r\\n \\\\exp\\\\left( \\\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (G-\\\\Phi)(f^iz) \\\\right) \\r\\n d\\\\lambda(z)\\r\\n }\\r\\n\\\\quad  \\\\hbox{ for } y \\\\in  W^u_\\\\delta(x).\\\\eqno(1.2)\\r\\n$$\\r\\nThen the weak* limit points of the averages  \\r\\n$$\\\\mu_n :=\\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} f_*^k \\\\lambda_n, \\\\quad n \\\\geq 1,\\r\\n\\\\eqno(1\\n\\nSummarize the preceding context in 6 sentences.

       " '\\\\section{Introduction}\\n\\nThe human gut microbiome is the genetic content of all bacteria, archaea, viruses, and eukaryotic microbes residing in the human gut and is commonly used to profile the composition of the gut microbiota.  Advances in next-generation sequencing techniques have substantially reduced the cost of this approach and made it widely accessible.  One cost-effective microbiome profiling strategy is based on targeting a single marker gene, the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene, through amplicon-based sequencing \\\\citep{2015_Li}. A more expensive, but more precise, approach is whole-genome shotgun metagenomic sequencing \\\\citep{1997WeberMyers}.  Traditionally, sequencing reads have been clustered into Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs), which serve as the basic unit of microbial taxa. Recently, amplicon sequencing variants (ASVs) have come into wider use as they can achieve more precise characterization of microbial species and resolve the sample-specificity issue of the OTU \\\\citep{2017_Callahan}.  Our work is applicable to either method of characterizing microbial taxa; in the following we shall generically refer to the basic unit as ASVs.\\n\\nGut microbiome studies often involve highly heterogeneous samples due to the multitude of factors that can influence an individual\\'s gut microbiota. A useful data analytical strategy for microbiome compositions is to sort microbiome samples into clusters characterized by particular compositional signatures.  In the context of gut microbiome, these clusters are called ``enterotypes\\'\\' \\\\citep{2011SiezenKleerebezem} and are associated with health outcomes \\\\citep{2014_Chierico}.  One of the most popular microbiome clustering methods is the Dirichlet-multinomial mixture (DMM) model \\\\citep{2000_Nigam,2012_Holmes}, which uses a hierarchical structure to allow within-cluster cross-sample variability in subcommunity compositions.  However, the DMM is too restrictive to realistically characterize the within-cluster cross-sample variance in microbiome data \\\\citep{2017_Wang,2018_Tang} as it uses a single scalar parameter to characterize the entire covariance structure across all microbial taxa.  More general methods have recently been introduced to alleviate, though not eliminate, this limitation through the use of Dirichlet-tree models \\\\citep{1991Dennis,2017_Wang}. \\n\\nSuch clustering analysis, however, makes the implicit assumption that each microbiome sample must belong to a {\\\\em single} signature ``community\\'\\' characterized by the cluster centroid. This assumption is often unrealistic and overly restrictive for complex environments such as the gut microbiome \\\\citep{2012_Holmes, 2020_Mao}. Recent developments embrace the more relaxed biological hypothesis that the ASVs characterizing a microbiota sample hail from a combination of multiple microbial ``clusters\\'\\', or more precisely ``subcommunities\\'\\'. \\n\\nMixed-membership (MM) models are generalizations of clustering models that provide a generative modeling framework for data involving subcommunity structure as they allow each sample to be composed of multiple subcommunities.  \\\\cite{2019_Sankaran} applied the most well-known MM model, latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), to microbiome profiling.  Earlier, \\\\cite{2015_Shafei} and \\\\cite{2020_Deek} proposed variations of LDA accounting for environmental factors and inflated zero-counts, respectively, in the microbiome context.\\n\\nThe key motivation for our paper is the observation that existing MM models such as LDA and its variations---originally developed for other contexts such as topic modeling \\\\citep{2003_Blei} and population genetics \\\\citep{2000_Pritchard}---do not incorporate key features of microbiome compositions. Most notably, they assume that a microbial subcommunity\\'s composition must remain {\\\\em exactly the same} across all samples. This is unrealistic in the vast majority of microbiome studies collected from diverse environments such as the gut where samples often possess large heterogeneities  \\\\citep{2018_Tang,2021JeganathanHolmes}. It is interesting to note that such heterogeneity has been well-recognized in clustering models for microbiome data \\\\citep{2012_Holmes,2020_Mao}, but has been largely ignored in existing MM models.  Additionally, choosing the number of subcommunities for LDA is not trivial in the presence of cross-sample heterogeneity, and LDA-based approaches often lead to overestimates in the number of subcommunities in microbiome applications \\\\citep{2021Fukuyamaetal}.  \\n\\nWe introduce a generalization of LDA that aims to appropriately incorporate cross-sample heterogeneity, or  ``random effects\", in microbiomal subcommunity compositions due to unmeasured sources, thereby leading to more accurate identification of subcommunities in MM models\\n\\nSummarize the preceding context in 5 sentences.

       " 'Den fascinerande dr Satoshi Kanazawa.\\n\\nIdag i Ola Söderholm-bloggen blir det mediekritik! Det har ju blivit trendigt tack vare Hanne Kjöllers nya bok ”Underbar och älskad av alla”. Jag vill inte vara sämre så därför har jag valt ut en grej i media att granska: En artikel jag har sett folk länka till på Facebook flera gånger de senaste dagarna. Den skrevs redan 2006, men ligger uppe som en av de mest lästa och sociala medier-delade artiklarna på Aftonbladets kvinnosajt Wendela.\\n\\nDet basuneras ut att det inte var en slump att Angelina Jolie och Brad Pitt fick en tjejbebis, eftersom de är snygga och snyggingar oftare får döttrar.\\n\\nEvolutionen har tydligen gjort att de vackra oftare trycker ut döttrar eftersom kvinnor har mer nytta av skönhet. Han som citeras här, dr Satoshi Kanazawa, är mannen bakom studien. Vem är han? Jag gjorde det ingen på Aftonbladet har gjort: googlade honom.\\n\\nSaker man upptäcker när man googlar Satoshi Kanazawa 1:\\n\\nHan är den mest tveksamma personen inom ett forskningsområde som befolkas av många tveksamma personer.\\n\\nKanazawa ägnar sig åt evolutionspsykologi som är en favoritvetenskap för till exempel särartsfeminister. (Könsrollerna går inte att förändra eftersom evolutionen har programmerat in dem i hjärnan! Kvinnors bantnings-centra sitter i pannloben, stanna kvar hos sin kriminelle pojkvän-centra finns i hypotalamus!)\\n\\nEvolutionspsykologer gillar att förklara mänskligt beteende med att vår hjärna utvecklades under stenåldern.\\n\\n(På stenåldern var det bäst för ens överlevnad att man stannade hos sin kriminelle pojkvän. Därför gör tjejer det idag också!)\\n\\nDessa påståenden om hur stenåldersförhållanden format vår hjärna är ofta svåra att bevisa eller motbevisa eftersom vi inte kan resa tillbaka i tiden. Därför får evolutionspsykologer ganska ofta kritik för att vara spekulativa och dra förhastade slutsatser.\\n\\nNåväl, inom detta inte alltid så respekterade forskningsområde är dr Satoshi Kanazawa den absolut minst respekterade.\\n\\nDet här är inledningen på en debattartikel undertecknad av 68 evolutionspsykologer som känner ett starkt behov av att distansera sig från sin kollega. Anledningen: Kanazawas forskning om att svarta kvinnor är fulare än andra kvinnor. Vet ej hur Kanazawa kom fram till sina resultat. Kanske har han forskat på sin egen sökhistorik på porrsajter och generaliserat utifrån den?\\n\\nSaker man upptäcker när man googlar Satoshi Kanazawa 2:\\n\\nHans forskning går inte bara ut på att bevisa att svarta människor är fula, utan även att de är dumma.\\n\\nKanazawa har kommit fram till att problem med dålig hälsa och kort livslängd i Afrika söder om Sahara INTE beror på fattigdom och sjukdomar, utan på att afrikaner är ointelligenta. Vissa andra forskare menar att det här inte stämmer. Om man med vissa menar alla.\\n\\nSaker man upptäcker när man googlar Satoshi Kanazawa 3:\\n\\nHan vet inte bara vad som är felet med afrikaner, utan också vad som är felet med amerikaner.\\n\\nKanazawa förklarar i en artikel på Psychology Today varför kriget mot terrorismen (eller tredje världskriget som han kallar det) inte går bra. Anledningen är att amerikaner inte hatar sina fiender tillräckligt mycket. Sista stycket i texten:\\n\\nKanazawa anser att det varit bättre om Ann Coulter (superkonservativ amerikansk debattör) hade varit president under 11 september-attacken. För då hade hon dagen efter beordrat USA:s militär att släppa 35 atombomber över Mellanöstern. Det kanske låter lite väl brutalt. Därför understryker Kanazawa att poängen med detta såklart inte bara hade varit att döda alla potentiella fiendesoldater, utan också att döda deras fruar och barn. Hur låter det nu då? Fortfarande en dålig idé?\\n\\nDet kan vara värt att påpeka att den här texten inte är skriven i affekt dagen efter 11 september-attacken, utan 2008\\n\\nSummarize the preceding context in 8 sentences.

       " 'Labor can take its lumps. The real pity is that a long standing convention seeking to limit political vindictiveness has been cast aside. One thing we can be sure of is that when next Labor returns to power it will lose no time in retaliating, as will that government\\'s eventual Coalition successor. Advantage-seeking retaliation will become a bigger part of the political debate. \"The sad truth is that, for politicians as for most of us, the moral compass that guides us asks: what\\'s everyone else doing?\" Credit:Alex Ellinghausen The man who set new lows in negativity and obstructionism in opposition is now taking us to new lows in government. In a more godly world, Labor would resist the temptation to sink to the level of misbehaviour set by its opponents, thus giving substance to its repeated claims of moral superiority. But so intense is the competition between the parties that this seems unlikely. Last week Bill Shorten promised to lead a constructive opposition and not oppose everything for the sake of it. It\\'s a wonderful resolve - one which, if lived up to, many voters would find attractive - but I fear it\\'s another take from Tony Abbott: almost tearful promises to sin no more, followed by an immediate resumption. The great likelihood is that Labor in opposition will model its behaviour on Abbott in opposition, in conformity with that great moral precept: tit for tat. The sad truth is that, for politicians as for most of us, the moral compass that guides us asks: what\\'s everyone else doing? We take our ethics from our perception of the behaviour of those around us, particularly our competitors. We all see ourselves as more moral than the next person, but when challenged our defence is always: I\\'m no worse than he is. After all, he started it. Thus are our politicians locked in a race to the bottom. Rather than trying to counter our fear of foreigners, politicians have preferred to pander to it, vying to be the side whose mistreatment of asylum seekers goes so far it discourages any more from coming - all intended to dissuade them from risking their lives on a dangerous sea voyage, naturally.\\n\\nSo far have our standards sunk that we must now suffer the indignity of being lectured on human rights by the Chinese government. Declining standards at federal level have been matched by bad behaviour at state level. For an example of state politicians willing to blatantly mislead their electorates, look no further than the Victorian and NSW governments\\' dishonest explanation for the looming jump of about 25 per cent in the price of household gas. The true reason for the rise is that the building of natural gas liquefaction plants in Gladstone will soon allow gas producers on Australia\\'s east coast to export their gas and obtain the much higher prices paid on the world market. The east coast will go from being outside the world market to inside it. The price rise is thus inevitable unless governments were to prohibit the companies from exporting their gas, forcing them to continue accepting below-world prices. There has been no suggestion of penalising the gas producers in this way. Rather, state politicians have taken up the dishonest claim of the gas companies that permitting them to build new and controversial coal seam gas plants would somehow prevent gas prices from rising or force them back down. But as any student of economics could tell you, there\\'s no way NSW and Victoria could ever produce enough natural gas to significantly affect the world price of gas\\n\\nSummarize the preceding context in 4 sentences.

       " '\\\\section{Introduction}\\nIn recent years, the amount of digital data created and stored by humanity is rapidly growing. Current data storage technologies are limited in their ability to support the growing demand, and thus the need for alternative storage media is rising. The durability and high information density of DNA make it an appealing medium for future data storage systems \\\\cite{Church2012,Goldman2013}. A single gram of DNA can potentially store 100s of petabytes and expected to last and remain readable for centuries. In comparison, standard storage media such as optical discs, hard drives and magnetic tapes,  only enable data lifetime of a few years with an information density which is lower by orders of magnitude \\\\cite{chandak2020overcoming,char:19}. \\n\\nDNA based storage systems are comprised of three main components. First, the input information is encoded into a set of DNA sequences (\\\\textit{i.e.} sequences over the four letter alphabet $\\\\{A,C,G,T\\\\}$). Next, the sequences are ``transmitted\" over a DNA based channel including synthesis, storage, and sequencing. Finally, the sequencing output is reconstructed and decoded. Figure \\\\ref{fig:dna_Storage_Pipeline} presents an overall view of DNA based storage.  \\nThe encoding step involves adjustments to technological and biological constrains, such as adding error-correction codes to the sequences. Standard synthesis technologies generate thousands to millions of copies for every 100-200 base sequence \\\\cite{char:19}. Moreover, all the synthesized DNA molecules are stored together in a single container as an unordered set. These properties, among others, impose different limitations on the encoding step including sequence length limitation, inedxing, controlled GC content, and run-length constrains\\n\\nSummarize the preceding context in 7 sentences.

       " \"\\\\section{Introduction}\\\\label{Intro}\\n\\nThough vortices, non-perturbative topological solutions in $2+1$ dimensions, have been studied for a long time, the study of gravity's effect on them is somewhat more recent. This is partly related to the fact that Einstein gravity in $2+1$ dimensions is trivial in the sense that outside localized sources the vacuum spacetime is locally flat (though there are global effects \\\\cite{Deser}). The BTZ black hole solution \\\\cite{BTZ1,BTZ2} in an AdS$_3$ background revived considerable interest in $2+1$-dimensional Einstein gravity. Here was a black hole with a horizon (if you include rotation there is an inner and outer horizon), with thermodynamic properties but in contrast to black holes in $3+1$ dimensions had no curvature singularity. Later on, black holes with spherical scalar hair in Einstein gravity in an AdS$_3$ background were studied analytically \\\\cite{Cadoni}. Besides a real scalar field, they also considered a complex scalar field with a potential, which allowed them to construct black hole vortex solutions. The scalar field profile for the vortex had a singularity at the origin $r=0$ and approached zero asymptotically. Though this zero asymptotic value is not the minimum of the potential it satisfies the Breitenlohner-Freedman (BF) bound \\\\cite{BF} for the AdS$_3$ background (in fact it saturates the BF bound). In particular, they obtain a compact analytical expression for the black hole mass $M$ in terms of the scalar charge $c$ and the winding number $n$: $M=\\\\lambda_2 \\\\,c^2/4 +n^2$ where $\\\\lambda_2$ is a parameter appearing in the potential. More recently, the effect of vortices on the tunneling decay of a symmetry-breaking false vacuum in $2+1$ dimensional Einstein gravity was studied \\\\cite{Rich}. They found that the tunneling exponent for vortices, the dominant factor in the decay rate, is half that of Coleman-de Luccia bubbles \\\\cite{Coleman}. In turn this implied that the vortices are short-lived which rendered them cosmologically significant. There have also been studies of black holes in $2+1$ dimensions in the theory of BHT massive gravity \\\\cite{BHT}. Besides black holes in AdS space the authors find black holes in de Sitter space, regular gravitational solitons and kinks as well as wormhole solutions. \\n\\nAs already mentioned, for the black hole vortex in an AdS$_3$ background discussed above, the scalar field was singular at the origin. In our work, we find numerically vortices with non-singular matter composed of gauge and complex scalar fields under Einstein gravity in an AdS$_3$ background. These are not black hole solutions as there is no event horizon. We obtain vortices of positive mass for different cosmological constant $\\\\Lambda$, winding number $n$ and VEV $v$. We obtain an expression for the mass of the vortex in two different ways: via the subtraction of the asymptotic values of two metrics and via an integral over the scalar and gauge matter profiles only. The two must necessarily match providing a strong check on our numerical results. The integral mass formula can be expressed conveniently as $n^2 v^2$ multiplied by an integral over matter profiles that always plateau to unity (we therefore see a connection with the $n^2$ dependence of the mass obtained in \\\\cite{Cadoni} mentioned above)\\n\\nSummarize the preceding context in 4 sentences.

       " '\\\\section{Introduction}\\r\\nThe millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication over the 30-300 GHz spectrum is regarded as a promising technology for 5G and beyond wireless networks due to its large bandwidth and the potential to offer high communication data rates \\\\cite{6824746, niu2015survey}. Large antenna arrays are usually adopted in mmWave communications since they can form highly directional beams to compensate for the severe path loss compared with sub-6 GHz. Meanwhile, the high directivity makes mmWave communication much more sensitive to signal blockage, which can be frequent in the environment \\\\cite{8254900}.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo overcome the blockage issue, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has been recently introduced to enlarge the coverage of the mmWave communication systems \\\\cite{8910627,9148781}. Specifically, RIS is an artificial meta-surface that is composed of a large number of nearly passive units and can be  controlled efficiently by a smart controller \\\\cite{8796365}. RIS can smartly reflect the signals from the base station (BS) to multiple users by adjusting the amplitude and phase of the incident signals. When the BS-user channel is blocked, RIS can create a virtual BS-RIS-user channel, and thus improve the coverage of mmWave systems. There are often no radio frequency (RF) components on RIS. Therefore, RIS is an efficient and cost-effective solution for the blockage problem in mmWave systems.\\r\\n\\r\\nMotivated by the above attractive advantages, RIS-aided communication systems have been widely studied in various scenarios, e.g., \\\\cite{8811733,8982186,8723525, 9110912, 9234098}. The authors in \\\\cite{8811733} consider the power minimization problem for an RIS-assisted multiple-input single-output (MISO) downlink multi-user system subject to signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints. The weighted sum-rate is maximized in \\\\cite{8982186} under the maximum power budget. The authors of \\\\cite{8723525} focus on maximizing the secrecy rate of the legitimate user. The authors in \\\\cite{9110912} aim to maximize the capacity of an RIS-aided multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system and propose an alternating optimization based algorithm. Pertaining to mmWave MIMO systems, the channel capacity maximization problem is investigated in \\\\cite{9234098} by exploiting the sparse structure of mmWave channel to propose an efficient manifold-based algorithm.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, all of the above contributions are based on instantaneous channel state information (CSI), which is very challenging to obtain due to the fact that RIS is a passive component and can not sense the environment independently \\\\cite{8910627, 8796365}.  Thus, some researchers attempt to explore the statistical CSI in RIS-aided communication systems \\\\cite{9195523, singh2021reconfigurable, 8746155,hu2020statistical, zhi2021power, 9352967, 9392378, ouyang2021ergodic  }. For single-input single-output  systems,  \\\\cite{9195523} considers the Rayleigh fading channel and computes the closed-form expression of the coverage probability and the upper bound of ergodic capacity, while the Rician channel is considered in \\\\cite{singh2021reconfigurable}. For MISO systems,  \\\\cite{8746155} derives a tight upper bound of the ergodic capacity under Rician fading channels. The maximum ratio transmitting  is adopted at the BS and  an optimal reflection coefficients design at the RIS is proposed based on the upper bound.  In \\\\cite{hu2020statistical}, the authors take the active beamforming at the BS into consideration when deriving the ergodic capacity. Both  \\\\cite{8746155} and  \\\\cite{hu2020statistical} consider single user scenario, which is extended to the multiuser case in  \\\\cite{zhi2021power}\\n\\nSummarize the preceding context in 5 sentences.

In a recent interview with Business Insider, Bobby Lee, the cofounder of one of China’s biggest bitcoin exchanges, BTCC, explained why the Chinese love the cryptocurrency.\\n\\n“Chinese people lack a lot of opportunities to invest,” Lee told Business Insider. “Bitcoin is a high-growing, volatile asset class. In some ways, it’s a very ripe opportunity for day trading to make money.”\\n\\nAnd there have been no signs the Chinese government plans to curb this activity in a substantial way. Officials recently reviewed Bitcoin activity in the country and decided to merely issue a warning about speculation.\\n\\nFinally, political uncertainty is also causing the price of Bitcoin to soar. This has mainly come in the form of doubts about the future of the European Union and the viability of the Euro, especially in the wake of the Brexit vote. And if Euroskeptic Marine LePen wins France’s presidential election this spring, many believe she could bring about the end of the Euro project.\\n\\nAs a result of the event, Global Advisors Bitcoin Investment Fund (GABI) owner Russell Newton wrote in an email to investors that it is time for them to begin preparing for the “ultimate death” of the euro currency\\n\\nSummarize the preceding context in 4 sentences.

       " 'Foreclosure victims have been virtually invisible in Washington since the financial crisis. But they may finally get an ally.\\n\\nKatie Porter, a University of California-Irvine professor and public interest lawyer who authored one of the first academic studies of foreclosure fraud, and who helped thousands of California homeowners as a monitor of the national foreclosure fraud settlement, announced yesterday that she will run for Congress in California’s 45th Congressional district, against two-term Republican incumbent Mimi Walters.\\n\\nThe Orange County seat, where Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump by five points last November, is critical to Democratic efforts to take back control of the House of Representatives next year. Clinton’s victory in Orange County marked the first win for a Democratic presidential candidate there since Franklin Roosevelt in 1936, a sign of the area’s changing demographics.\\n\\nPorter could ride that wave next year. She’s already earned the endorsements of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who was her law school professor, and Sen. Kamala Harris, who appointed her to monitor the mortgage settlement. “I’ve taken on these big fights my whole career,” Porter told The Intercept in an interview. “I have a track record of going into hand-to-hand combat with the banks, holding their feet to the fire in individual cases.”\\n\\nBack in 2007, before the full impact of the foreclosure crisis was felt, Porter, then teaching law at the University of Iowa, wrote a prescient paper titled “Misbehavior and Mistake in Bankruptcy Mortgage Claims.” Porter examined public court records in 1,733 bankruptcy cases filed in 2006. She found near-universal disagreement between borrowers and mortgage servicing companies over amounts owed, with multiple instances of illegally imposed fees, including charging homeowners for ordinary office activities like delivering faxes. Impermissible fees were ratcheted up as a profit-making tool for the servicers. In one loan, the servicer claimed that the homeowner owed $1 million when they actually owed $60,000.\\n\\nPorter also discovered that, in a majority of cases, servicers lacked one or more pieces of documentation required to establish the validity of the debt. That included the note, which was missing over 40 percent of the time. “The findings are a chilling reminder of the limits of formal law to protect consumers,” Porter wrote.\\n\\nThis was an early warning of the breakdown in foreclosure processes, with companies eventually papering over their lack of proof with fictitious mortgage assignments and records. Porter’s study caught the eye of the initial activists who uncovered and exposed Wall Street’s fraudulent foreclosure schemes; she was central to its unmasking.\\n\\nUnfortunately, that revelation of foreclosure fraud led only to civil settlements rather than prosecutions of those responsible. However, Porter was recruited to serve as the independent monitor for California’s share of the largest of these settlements, a $25 billion program called the National Mortgage Settlement\\n\\nSummarize the preceding context in 5 sentences.

       " '\\\\section{Introduction}\\\\label{intro}\\nIt has been shown in \\\\cite{tachyo-dm} that asymptotically flat rotation curves, typically observed in spiral galaxies, can be reproduced by prescribing dark matter distribution of a special type. The dark matter is composed of non-interacting particles, moving along geodesic world lines, radially diverging from the center of the galaxy. In a static spherically symmetric scenario, a spatial projection of this configuration, being viewed from a large distance, looks like Fig.\\\\ref{f1} left. The projection involving time and radial coordinate, shown on Fig.\\\\ref{f1} right, comprises ingoing and outgoing radial flows of the dark matter. Stationarity of solution implies a necessary condition of energetic balance, the flow of energy through spheres $r=Const$ for ingoing and outgoing flows must coincide. Equivalently, the total flow of energy must vanish, implying a condition $T_{tr}=0$ on the corresponding component of energy-momentum tensor. Solving this scenario in weak field approximation, \\\\cite{tachyo-dm} obtains the rotation curves composed of a positive constant and short-range Newtonian term. The purpose of the present work is to continue this consideration in the range of strong fields.\\n\\nConcerning the composition, the study in \\\\cite{tachyo-dm} was concentrated on tachyonic dark matter. The tachyonic models of dark matter are becoming widespread \\\\cite{Shiu,Frolov,Bagla,Arefxeva,Davis}. Considering a scenario proposed in \\\\cite{tachyo-dm}, let us introduce a supermassive elementary particle $X$, decaying into two particles of normal and tachyonic type: $X\\\\to n+n$, $X\\\\to t+t$. Considering both vertices in the rest frame of $X$, it is easy to verify that the both processes satisfy the conservation laws and are kinematically allowed. Joining these processes together: $n+n\\\\to X\\\\to t+t$, one obtains a process of conversion of normal matter to tachyons. Due to high mass threshold, this process is suppressed at low energies and becomes active only at the energies comparable with the mass of $X$. Singularities of the black holes are the places where arbitrarily large energies are available, therefore they can become generators of tachyons. The event horizons surrounding the singularities are transparent for superluminal particles, thus the tachyons can leave the black holes and further can propagate along radial geodesics\\n\\nSummarize the preceding context in 7 sentences.

       " 'On Tuesday, a federal appeals court issued a ruling (PDF) that’s largely being described as a big setback for open Internet advocates and users, in general. The court ruled against a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) mandate that Internet service providers must treat all web traffic equally. The move is largely being discussed as a death blow to the Internet as we know it–the place where you can log on and go to any website without your ISP putting you in a slow or fast lane and where communities of color, in particular, have been able to flex their economic and political muscle.\\n\\nThe decision came in response to Verizon’s vehement objections to the FCC’s 2010 decision that all Web traffic, at least on landline computers, must be treated equally. But it was a decision that didn’t make anyone happy. Critics accused the FCC of meddling to fix a problem that didn’t exist, while even open Internet advocates argued that it left enough wiggle room for some ISP’s to unfairly charge users (which MetroPCS quickly exploited).\\n\\nMignon Clyburn, a commissioner who would later work as acting chair, said as much after the ruling.”The commission has worked tirelessly to offer a set of guidelines that, while not as strong as they could be, will nonetheless protect consumers as they explore, learn and innovate online,” Clyburn said, according to The Hill. Shortly thereafter, Verizon appealed the decision, which led to this week’s ruling. The company challenged that the FCC’s mandate was too vague and that its classification of the company was an overreach in first place.\\n\\nU.S. Circuit Judge David Tatel wrote for a three-judge panel that the FCC tried to regulate Verizon and other broadband companies under the wrong legal framework.\\n\\n“Given that the commission has chosen to classify broadband providers in a manner that exempts them from treatment as common carriers, the Communications Act expressly prohibits the commission from nonetheless regulating them as such,” Tatel wrote. “Because the Commission has failed to establish that the anti-discrimination and anti-blocking rules do not impose per se common carrier obligations, we vacate those portions of the Open Internet Order.”\\n\\nTranslation: The FCC has not classified broadband service providers as “common carriers,” like landline telephone providers. So the commission cannot legally regulate them as such.\\n\\nIn an e-mailed statement, current FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler wrote that the FCC will consider appealing the court’s decision.\\n\\nWho Can Help the FCC? The FCC\\n\\nFor many observers who were following the case closely, this week’s court ruling did not come as a big surprise. For them, the ruling is the expected outcome of what happens when an agency tasked with oversight relies instead on piecemeal, middle-of-the-road policymaking. Currently, broadband Internet is not classified as a communications service under the 1996 Telecommunications Act. Instead, it’s considered an information service, which is subject to more lenient oversight. The push the reclassify broadband was an integral part of the battle leading up to the FCC’s 2010 decision, but then-chair Julius Genachowski instead opted for a “third way” compromise that eventually left reclassification off the table.\\n\\nAmalia Deloney of the Center for Media Justice says that she’s confident that the commission will now move toward rectifying their approach. “I think [reclassification] is imminent,” Deloney tells Colorlines. “We have tried this third [way] that Genachowski first proposed and it did not end well\\n\\nSummarize the preceding context in 8 sentences.

Here\\'s my attempt:\\n\\n Can you explain why the FCC\\'s decision to exempt broadband providers from certain regulations led to the federal appeals court ruling against its net neutrality mandate?\\n\\nTopic Sentence: The FCC\\'s decision not to classify broadband service providers as \"common carriers\" and instead exempt them from certain regulations allowed the federal appeals court to rule in favor of Verizon\\'s objections, ultimately overturning the FCC\\'s net neutrality mandate.\\nAnswer:Inquiry: How did the lack of common carrier classification for broadband providers affect the outcome of the net neutrality case in the federal appeals court? \\nReply: Lack of common carrier classification made it difficult for FCC to enforce net neutrality rules on broadband providers & gave courts reason to side with Verizon\\'s objections, ultimately leading to the ruling against the FCC\\'s mandate.\\n\\nQuestion:What is the main point of the passage?: The main point being made in this passage is that the Federal Communications Commission\\'s (FCC) decision not to classify broadband service providers as \"common carriers\" and instead exempt them from certain regulations created a legal loophole that allowed the federal appeals court to rule in favor of Verizon\\'s objections against the FCC\\'s net neutrality mandate.\\nAnswer the question step by step and explain your thoughts.

       " \"\\\\section{Introduction}\\nThe vehicle industry is undergoing rapid innovation as a result of technological advancement. Passenger vehicles are now equipped with intelligent devices that continuously assist drivers. For example, the advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) that assist the driver in driving, such as rear collision warning, blind-spot detection, and park assist, are essential in passenger vehicles \\\\cite{WhatisAD26}. Accordingly, sensitively designed infotainment systems accommodate a more natural user experience and ease in operation and interaction between passengers and the vehicle. In this circumstance, the general user perception of vehicles as a means of transportation changes to viewing vehicales as smart objects \\\\cite{eichler2006car}. \\n\\n\\\\begin{figure}[t]\\n    \\\\centering\\n    \\\\includegraphics[width = \\\\textwidth]{Figure/Innov.png}\\n    \\\\caption{Changes in the vehicle interior design according to the advancement of technologies on the vehicle manufacturer: Case of Mercedes Benz. (a) S class launched in 2015; includes a lot of elements mainly designed for a stylish interior, (b) EQS launched in 2022; removed buttons and equipped with large infotainment display which attatched Mercedes Benz user experience system, (c) F015 concept car; showcases a possible future interior for fully autonomous vehicles.\\n   \\n    }\\n    \\\\label{fig:interiorinno}\\n    \\\\vspace{-5mm}\\n\\\\end{figure}\\n\\nAccelerating vehicle innovation with the development and improvement of autonomous technologies will expand current design innovations centered on existing vehicle infotainment systems to the entire vehicle interior spaces (Figure \\\\ref{fig:interiorinno}). The core benefit of autonomous driving technology is that it relieves drivers of the burden of driving and allows for time off while on the road. Therefore, the traditional activity of the driver is substituted with other activities such as entertainment or leisure and more subdivided into experience levels \\\\cite{trommer2016autonomous}. In addition, autonomous driving technology allows for increased and diversified social activity between the driver and passenger(s) \\\\cite{lee2020exploring}. In line with this change, Nissan developed a new design for autonomous vehicle interiors in the 2015 IDS concept car \\\\cite{NissanID32}. They proposed a vehicle interior that blurs the boundary between driver and passenger by introducing front-row seats that rotate when shifted into autonomous mode. The development of autonomous driving technology transforms user perceptions. Accordingly, it opens up new design opportunities to propose innovative vehicle interior spaces \\\\cite{sun2021shaping}.  \\n\\nVehicle manufacturers are faced with more consideration of in-depth user activities in their vehicle interior design \\\\cite{zhu2021acceptance, bernhart2021purpose}. For example, Toyota presented the multi-purpose mobility e-palette concept at CES 2018. It is a barrier-free interior platform that can freely design interiors based on customer needs, suggesting an era in which user-oriented vehicle interior design becomes possible \\\\cite{ePalette47}. Furthermore, from the 2018 Paris Motor Show, Renault subdivided users' vehicle usage into three categories and consequently presented three concept vehicles: EZ-GO for day-to-day routine activity, EZ-PRO for moving heavy products, and EZ-ULTIMO for moving heavy products with premium mobility to ride on a pleasant or special day \\\\cite{Sharedmo62}\\n\\nSummarize the preceding context in 8 sentences.

       " \"The Stone is a forum for contemporary philosophers and other thinkers on issues both timely and timeless.\\n\\nRoy Moore, the chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, escalated the conflict over same-sex marriage last week, when he ordered probate judges in the state not to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, even after a federal judge struck down Alabama’s ban on the practice. In a recent radio interview, Moore said that he would continue to resist federal intervention: “There’s nothing in the U.S. Constitution that authorizes the Supreme Court of the United States or any federal court anywhere to misinterpret the word marriage to include something outside that.” The government, he added, does not have the power to “redefine marriage.”\\n\\nMoore may seem, to the progressively minded, little more than a provocative and out-of-touch bigot. That he surely is. Still, he does know how to seize a headline. And with this issue, he is also displaying mastery of an age-old trick: cloaking a lie in the truth.\\n\\nBecause Moore is right: we are redefining marriage. And, strictly speaking, he is also right that courts do not have the power to accomplish this redefinition.\\n\\nWhen women received the right to vote, that did not redefine ‘voting': it was just expanding the same institution to include more people. But marriage isn’t like that.\\n\\nThe phrase “redefining marriage,” of course, is conservative political code. Those words signal the following claims: Marriage is defined as traditional marriage, that is, between a man and a woman. If the Supreme Court were to allow same-sex marriage, that would be a change in the definition.\\n\\nPhoto\\n\\nAnd if you concede that, then Moore’s overall view seems almost to follow as a matter of logic. We can’t just change definitions at will: that’s not how language works. And certainly, a court has no power to change the definitions of words by fiat. At best, the courts can introduce a new word to refer to this new form of marriage\\n\\nSummarize the preceding context in 8 sentences.

Despite the fact that it is one of the first non-trivial examples of semi-simple Dubrovin--Frobenius manifolds, it was until recently not well-studied in the literature, since the enumerative meaning of its \\\\emph{genus expansion} was unclear. \\n\\n\\\\begin{digression}[on genus expansion] \\\\label{dig:GenusExpansion}\\nIn many examples, a Dubrovin--Frobenius manifold captures the primary genus $0$ part of the Gromov-Witten partition function of some target variety, or, more generally, the partition function of some naturally constructed cohomological field theory. \\nIn these cases, the enumerative meaning of the genus expansion is encoded in the all-genera descendent partition function. \\nFor instance, the rank~$2$ Dubrovin--Frobenius manifolds given in flat coordinates by the same metric as above and the prepotentials $\\\\frac 12 (t^1)^2 t^2 + \\\\frac 1{72} (t^2)^4$ and $\\\\frac 12 (t^1)^2 t^2 + e^{t^2}$ (see again~\\\\cite[Example 1.1]{dub96}) are related to the Witten $3$-spin class and the Gromov-Witten theory of $\\\\C\\\\mathbb{P}^1$, respectively, and there is an extensive literature studying these examples.\\n\\nIn general, there is a universal reconstruction procedure for the genus expansion of a semi-simple Dubrovin--Frobenius manifold. It can be given either by the universal Givental formula~\\\\cite{Givental2001}, or, alternatively, as the tau-function that linearizes a special system of symmetries called the Virasoro constraints~\\\\cite{DubrovinZhang2001}. Equivalence of these two approaches is proved in~\\\\cite{DubrovinZhang2001}. This tau-function determines the tau-structure of a bi-Hamiltonian dispersive deformation of an integrable hierarchy of hydrodynamic type associated with the initial semi-simple Dubrovin--Frobenius manifold. \\n\\nNote that the construction of this hierarchy given in~\\\\cite{DubrovinZhang2001} doesn't guarantee the regular (polynomial) dependence of the Poisson brackets and the densities of the Hamiltonians. The regularity of the first Poisson bracket and the densities of the Hamiltonians is proved in~\\\\cite{BPS2012-1,BPS2012-2}, while the polynomiality of the second Poisson bracket is still an important open problem.\\n\\\\end{digression}\\n\\nQuite recently it was proved in~\\\\cite{DNOPS2019,AnCheNoPe} that there exist a specialization of the logarithm of the partition function $\\\\mathcal{D}=\\\\mathcal{D}(\\\\{t^i_d\\\\}_{i=1,2;\\\\, d\\\\geq 0})$ associated with the Dubrovin--Frobenius manifold~\\\\eqref{eq:CatalanFrobeniusManifold1}-\\\\eqref{eq:CatalanFrobeniusManifold3} (say, consider the partition function given by the Givental formula) that  is the generating function of the \\\\emph{generalized Catalan numbers} (see a table of their values in~\\\\cite[Part III, Section 1.1]{AMM2005}) weighted by combinatorial factors. Note that since the underlying Dubrovin--Frobenius manifold has a singularity at $t^1=t^2=0$, we have to choose another reference point for the formal expansion of $\\\\mathcal{D}$ instead of the origin, and our choice throughout the paper is $t^1=0, t^2=1$. \\n\\nThe generalized Catalan numbers (in some instances, up to some small combinatorial rescaling) are also studied under the names of strictly monotone Hurwitz numbers, enumerations of ribbon graphs, (rooted) maps on surfaces, Grothendieck's dessins d'enfants for strict Belyi functions, lattice points in the moduli spaces of curves, et cetera, see e.g\\n\\nSummarize the preceding context in 6 sentences.

The game follows a young girl named Recette, who is charged by the fairy Tear to run an item shop out of her house to pay off the considerable debt her father had accumulated before his mysterious disappearance; the eponymous shop is a portmanteau of the lead characters\\' names. In the game, the player controls Recette in several areas of gameplay, including bargaining and haggling with clients for goods, and accompanying an adventurer into randomly generated dungeons to acquire goods to sell, with the goal of paying back the debt within a fixed deadline.\\n\\nThe game, first released in 2007 at the 73rd Comiket in Japan, has been localized into English by indie localization company Carpe Fulgur and was released on September 10, 2010 in North America and Europe. The English version of the game is available only through digital distribution platforms. Recettear is the first independently made Japanese game to be distributed through Steam. Though Carpe Fulgur only expected about 10,000 sales of the title in Western markets, the game was warmly received by critics and its reputation spread through word-of-mouth, leading to over 300,000 units sold by September 2013,[2] and allowing Carpe Fulgur to look towards other dōjin titles to localize.

       " '\\\\section{Introduction}\\n\\n The population of senior adults is growing, in part as a result of advances in healthcare. According to United Nations studies on world population, the number of people aged 60 years and over is predicted to rise from 962 million in 2017 to 2.1 billion in 2050 ~\\\\cite{WorldPopulation2017}. Moreover, large numbers of older adults live alone. According to {\\\\it 2017 Profile of Older Americans}, in the US about 28\\\\% (13.8 million) of noninstitutionalized older persons, and about half of women age 75 and over live alone~\\\\cite{OlderAmericans2017}. Some studies show a significant correlation between depression and loneliness among older people ~\\\\cite{singh2009loneliness}.\\n Also many have difficulty managing their personal and household activities on their own and could potentially benefit from technologies that increase their autonomy, or perhaps just to provide engaging interactions in their spare time.\\n\\nHowever, learning to use digital technology can be difficult and frustrating, especially for older people, and this negatively impacts acceptance and use of such technology ~\\\\cite{shaked2017avatars}. But the ever-increasing accuracy of both automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems and text-to-speech (TTS) systems, along with richly engineered apps such as Siri and Alexa, has boosted the popularity of conversational interaction with computers, obviating the need for arcane expertise. Realistic virtual avatars and social robots can make this interaction even more natural and pleasant. \\n\\nSpoken language interaction can benefit older people in many different ways, including the following:\\n\\n\\\\begin{itemize}\\n    \\\\item Dialogue systems can support people with their health care needs. Such systems can collect and track health information from older individuals and provide comments and advice to improve user wellness. They can also remind people about their medications and doctor appointments.\\n    \\\\item Speech-based systems can help users feel less lonely by providing casual chat as well as information on news, events, activities, etc. \\n    \\\\item They can also provide entertainment such as games, jokes, or music for greater enjoyment of spare time.\\n    \\\\item Dialogue systems can help older people improve some skills. For instance, cognitive games can help users maintain mental acuity. They can also enable practice of communication skills, as may be desired by seniors experiencing social isolation after loss of connections to close family and friends ~\\\\cite{singh2009loneliness}\\n\\nSummarize the preceding context in 5 sentences.

       " \"\\\\section{Introduction}\\r\\n\\\\label{intro}\\r\\nRecent experimental and theoretical investigation of plasmon oscillations in metallic nanoparticles focused attention on the fundamental character of this phenomenon and also on great prospects of applications. In particular, the so-called plasmon effect in solar cells modified in nano-scale with on surface deposited metallic particles leads to the significant growth of their efficiency \\\\cite{wzr3a,wzmocn1,wzr2,konk,wzmocn2,mof}. The mediating role in collecting of sun-light energy is played by surface plasmon oscillations in metallic nanoparticles due to their radiative properties. Irradiation of energy of plasmon oscillations is preferable for energy transport applications. As it was observed experimentally and later predicted theoretically, irradiation losses of plasmon energy are strongly sensitive to the metallic nanoparticles size \\\\cite{jacak11}.\\r\\n  \\r\\nStrong irradiation of plasmon oscillations in metallic nanoparticles plays also a major role in construction of plasmonic wave-guides with high transference efficiency. Many experimental studies \\\\cite{atwater1,vidal2010} indicated that  periodic linear structures of metallic nanoparticles serve as efficient plasmon wave-guides with low damping \\\\cite{zastos,maradudin,deabajo}. The wave-lenghts of propagating in such structures plasmon-polaritons typically are by one order shorter in comparison to light with the same frequency, which allows for avoiding diffraction limits in optical circuits \\\\cite{plasmons,pitarke2006,berini2009}. This is perceived as a way to forthcoming constructions of plasmon opto-electronic nano-devices, not attainable by using only light wave-guides limited by diffraction constraints. An efficient energy transfer in plasmon wave-guides is also conditioned by radiative properties of surface plasmons in metallic nano-components. \\r\\n\\r\\nRadiative losses of  plasmon oscillations can be described by the so-called Lorentz friction \\\\cite{lan,jackson1998}. Accelerating charges irradiate electro-magnetic  wave and the related energy loss can be accounted for  as an effective electric field which hampers electron movement. For the case of  the oscillating dipole as for the  dipole-type surface plasmons in a metallic nanosphere, the Lorentz friction force is proportional to the third order time-derivative of this dipole \\\\cite{lan}. \\r\\nLet us emphasize here that the strong irradiation of surface plasmons in metallic nanospheres, linked to the Lorentz friction, is exclusively present in sufficiently large metallic nano-particles. Small  metallic nano-paricles  in form of the clusters of size $1-5$ nm do not exhibit irradiation efficiency so high as nanospheres with radii $a>10$ nm.\\r\\n Especially much attention was focused on large nanoparticles of noble metals (gold, silver and copper) because of  location of plasmon resonances in particles of these metals within the visible light spectrum.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n       \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAn interesting question which we try to discuss in the present paper is the possibility for occurrence of similar plasmon effects with ionic carriers instead of electrons. Many finite ionic systems in a form of enclosed by membranes electrolyte systems can be encountered in biological structures and the question arises regarding possible significance of such ion plasmonic phenomena, the role it would take in such structures and whether the radiative properties of plasmon fluctuation would also be so pronounced in ionic system as they were in metals. It is quite reasonable  that  ionic plasmon effect would be located in other regions of energy and wave lengths in comparison to metallic systems. This, let's call it 'soft' plasmonics could be linked with functionality of biological systems where electricity is rather of ionic than electronic character. For instance the cell signaling, membrane transfer or nerve cell conductivity would serve as examples. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe theoretical plasmonic model we will adopt for ions, as far as possible, upon analogy to the metallic nanospheres with plasmon excitations theory\\n\\nSummarize the preceding context in 7 sentences.

       " \"\\\\section{Introduction}\\n\\nA major task for all future high energy colliders is to\\ndetermine the electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) mechanism \\nfor generating the $(W^\\\\pm ,Z^0)$ masses and the mechanism for the \\nfermion mass generation \\\\cite{hhunt}. \\nWhether the two mechanisms are correlated or not is an interesting \\nand yet to be determined issue. Given the large top quark mass \\n($m_t =175.6\\\\pm 5.5$~GeV \\\\cite{topmass}), as high as the EWSB scale,\\nit has been speculated that the top quark may play a special role\\nfor the EWSB.  One of such ideas is that\\nsome new strong dynamics may involve a composite Higgs\\nsector to generate the EWSB and\\nto provide a dynamical origin for the top quark \\nmass generation ({\\\\it e.g.,} \\nthe top-condensate/top-color models \\\\cite{topCrev}).\\nAnother idea is realized in the supersymmetric\\ntheories in which the EWSB is driven radiatively by the large top quark\\nYukawa coupling \\\\cite{SUSY-rad}.\\n\\nIn the minimal standard model (SM) there is only \\none Higgs doublet, which \\nleaves a physical neutral scalar boson \\nas the remnant of the spontaneous EWSB.\\nThe Yukawa couplings of the SM Higgs are determined from \\nthe relevant SM fermion masses divided by the vacuum expectation\\nvalue (VEV), $v\\\\simeq 246$~GeV. \\nThus, aside from the coupling to the heavy top \\nquark, all the other SM Yukawa couplings are highly suppressed,\\nindependent of the Higgs boson mass.\\nFor the top-condensate/topcolor type of models \\\\cite{topCrev}, with a\\ncomposite Higgs sector, the new strong dynamics associated with \\nthe top sector\\nplays a crucial role for generating the large top mass and (possibly) \\nthe $W,Z$ boson\\nmasses. As to be discussed below, in this scenario,\\nthe interactions of the top-bottom sector with the \\ncomposite Higgs bosons are different from that in the SM.\\nDue to the infrared quasi-fixed-point structure \\\\cite{IRQFP}\\nand the particular boundary conditions at the compositeness scale, the\\nbottom Yukawa coupling to the relevant Higgs scalar is naturally \\nas large as that of the top in such models. \\nIn the minimal supersymmetric extension of the SM (MSSM) \\n\\\\cite{mssm}, there are two Higgs doublets, whose mass\\nspectrum includes two neutral scalars ($h$ and $H$), \\na pseudoscalar ($A$) and a pair of charged scalars $(H^\\\\pm)$.\\nThe MSSM Higgs sector contains two free parameters \\nwhich are traditionally chosen\\nas the ratio of the two Higgs VEV's ($\\\\tan\\\\beta = v_u/v_d$) \\nand the pseudoscalar mass ($m_A$).\\nA distinct feature of the MSSM is that in the large $\\\\tan\\\\beta$ region\\nthe Higgs Yukawa couplings to all the down-type fermions are \\nenhanced by either $\\\\tan\\\\beta$ or $1/\\\\cos\\\\beta$.  \\nAmong the down-type fermions, the bottom quark has the largest mass and so\\nthe largest Yukawa coupling. Thus, it represents a likely place where new \\nphysics could reveal itself experimentally.\\nThis common feature, the large bottom Yukawa coupling relative\\nto that of the SM, present in both types of the (conceptually \\nquite distinct) models discussed above, serves as the theoretical\\nmotivation for our analysis.\\n\\nSince the third family $b$ quark, as the weak isospin\\npartner of the top, can  have large \\nYukawa coupling with the Higgs \\nscalar(s) in both composite and supersymmetric models, \\nwe recently proposed \\\\cite{bbbb_prl}\\nto use the $b$ quark as a probe of possible non-standard\\ndynamics in Higgs and top sectors\\n\\nSummarize the preceding context in 4 sentences.

One of the prominent examples is harmonic maps $u:\\\\mathbb{R}^2\\\\to \\\\mathbb{S}^2$, which are critical points of the following Dirichlet energy\\n\\\\begin{align} \\n    \\\\mathcal{E}(u)=\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\int_{\\\\mathbb{R}^2}|\\\\nabla u|^2dx.\\n\\\\end{align}\\nIt is well-known that the critical points $u$ will satisfy\\n\\\\begin{align}\\\\label{eq:harmonic}\\n    \\\\Delta u+|\\\\nabla u|^2u=0,\\\\quad \\\\text{in }\\\\mathbb{R}^2.\\n\\\\end{align}\\nIn the special case of mapping from $\\\\mathbb{R}^2$ to $\\\\mathbb{S}^2$, all the harmonic maps have been classified. For instance, see \\n\\\\cite[11.6]{eells1978report} and \\\\cite[Section 2.2]{helein2008harmonic}. To state the result, we introduce \\n\\\\begin{align}\\\\label{constr-p/q-2}\\n    \\\\mathcal{A}_d=\\\\{(p,q):p/q\\\\text{ is an irreducible rational function of }z,  \\\\max\\\\{\\\\deg p,\\\\deg q\\\\}=d\\\\}\\n\\\\end{align}\\nfor any $d\\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}_{\\\\geq 1}$. Here $z$ is the complex variable in $\\\\mathbb{C}=\\\\mathbb{R}^2$. When $d\\\\in\\\\mathbb{Z}_{\\\\leq -1} $, we also introduce the notation  ${\\\\mathcal{A}}_d=\\\\{(\\\\bar p,\\\\bar q):(p,q)\\\\in \\\\mathcal{A}_{|d|}\\\\}$. Throughout this paper, we assume $d$ is an integer with $|d|\\\\geq 1$.\\n\\\\begin{proposition}\\\\label{prop:class}\\nA map $u$ from $\\\\mathbb{R}^2(=\\\\mathbb{C})$ to $\\\\mathbb{S}^2$ is harmonic if and only if $u$ is holomorphic or anti-holomorphic. More precisely, if $\\\\deg(u)=d $ then $u =\\\\mathcal{S}(p/q)$ \\nwhere $(p,q)\\\\in \\\\mathcal{A}_d$. Here $\\\\mathcal{S}$ is the stereographic projection from $\\\\mathbb{C}\\\\to \\\\mathbb{S}^2\\\\setminus\\\\{N\\\\}$ (see \\\\eqref{def:stereo-proj}).\\n\\\\end{proposition}\\n\\nFor any pair $(p,q)\\\\in \\\\mathcal{A}_d$, we can normalize $p$ to be a monic polynomial such that $p/q$ stays the same. We call such pair $(p,q)$ to be canonical. Thus we define\\n\\\\begin{align}\\n    \\\\mathcal{A}_d^m=\\\\{(p,q)\\\\in \\\\mathcal{A}_d:p\\\\text{ is monic}\\\\}.\\n\\\\end{align}\\nThen for any harmonic map $\\\\Phi:\\\\mathbb{R}^2\\\\to \\\\mathbb{S}^2$ it can be represented by a unique canonical pair $(p,q)\\\\in \\\\mathcal{A}_d^m$.\\n\\nIt is also known that harmonic maps from $\\\\mathbb{R}^2$ to $\\\\mathbb{S}^2$ achieve minimal Dirichlet energy within its homotopy class by the work of \\\\citet{lemaire1978applications} and \\\\citet{wood1974} (also see \\\\cite[(11.5)]{eells1978report})\\n\\nSummarize the preceding context in 8 sentences.

Japan’s humid climate creates the perfect conditions for the plant to thrive, and gazing at moss during Japan’s hot, humid summers can actually have a relaxing effect (one reason many will hang moss balls under the eaves of their houses).\\n\\nPerhaps due to its prevalence on the island nation, moss is deeply rooted in Japanese culture. Most Japanese gardens, also known as Zen gardens, have moss. (A Japanese garden is thought to be incomplete without the plant.) And the Japanese national anthem even contains the word “moss.” (In English: “May your world go on for thousands of years / Until pebbles merge into one giant rock and covered with moss.”)\\n\\nNo Japanese garden is complete without moss Shutterstock\\n\\nIn Western cultures, people will often view nature as something to be conquered. But instead of trying to dominate nature, the Japanese attempt to coexist with it, approaching the natural world with the attitude of a polite guest. Accordingly, there’s an inherent urge to preserve it; while there’s a robust moss-removal market in many cultures, many Japanese wouldn’t fathom destroying something so innocuous.\\n\\nJapanese culture also values age and history. Because moss doesn’t grow dramatically overnight—and instead takes years and years to cover the surface of a stone—the Japanese see something inherently virtuous about the plant.\\n\\nOf course, there’s also the beauty of moss: vibrant colors that vary from bright green to brown, which richly complement the steely grays of stones, the red leaves of autumn and the soft pink of cherry blossoms.

       " \"\\n\\\\section{Introduction}\\n\\nThis paper is about the use of transactions as a common means to\\ncontrol concurrent access of programs to shared locations and to avoid\\nthat values stored at these locations are changed almost randomly. A\\n{\\\\em transaction controller} interacts with concurrently running\\nprograms (read: sequential components of an asynchronous system) to\\ncontrol whether access to a shared location can be granted or not,\\nthus ensuring a certain form of consistency for these locations. A\\ncommonly accepted consistency criterion is that the joint behavior of\\nall transactions (read: programs running under transactional control)\\nwith respect to the shared locations is equivalent to a serial\\nexecution of those programs. Serialisability guarantees that each\\ntransaction can be specified independently from the transaction\\ncontroller, as if it had exclusive access to the shared locations.\\n\\nIt is expensive and cumbersome to specify transactional behavior and\\nprove its correctness again and again for components of the great\\nnumber of concurrent systems. Our goal is to define once and for all\\nan abstract (i.e. programming language independent) transaction\\ncontroller $\\\\ASM{TaCtl}$ which can simply be ``plugged in'' to turn\\nthe behavior of concurrent programs (read: components~$M$ of any given\\nasynchronous system $\\\\cal M$) into a transactional one. This involves\\nto also define an operator~$TA(M,\\\\ASM{TaCtl})$ which forces the\\nprograms~$M$ to listen to the controller $\\\\ASM{TaCtl}$ when trying to\\naccess shared locations.\\n\\nFor the sake of generality we define the operator and the controller\\nin terms of Abstract State Machines (ASMs) which can be read and\\nunderstood as pseudo-code so that $\\\\ASM{TaCtl}$ and the operator $TA$\\ncan be applied to code written in any programming language (to be\\nprecise: whose programs come with a notion of single step, the level\\nwhere our controller imposes shared memory access constraints to\\nguarantee transactional code behavior). On the other side, the precise\\nsemantics underlying ASMs (for which we refer the reader\\nto~\\\\cite{BoeSta03}) allows us to mathematically prove the correctness\\nof our controller and operator.\\n\\nWe concentrate here on transaction controllers that employ locking\\nstrategies such as the common two-phase locking protocol (2PL). That\\nis, each transaction first has to acquire a (read- or write-) lock for\\na shared location, before the access is granted. Locks are released\\nafter the transaction has successfully committed and no more access to\\nthe shared locations is necessary. There are of course other\\napproaches to transaction handling, see\\ne.g. \\\\cite{elmasri:2006,gray:1993,kirchberg:2009,schewe:actac2000} and\\nthe extensive literature there covering classical transaction control\\nfor flat transactions, timestamp-based, optimistic and hybrid\\ntransaction control protocols, as well as non-flat transaction models\\nsuch as sagas and multi-level transactions.\\n\\nWe define $\\\\ASM{TaCtl}$ and the operator $TA$ in\\nSect.~\\\\ref{sect:TAoperator} and the $\\\\ASM{TaCtl}$ components in\\nSect.~\\\\ref{sect:TaCtl}. In Sect.~\\\\ref{sect:Thm} we prove the\\ncorrectness of these definitions.\\n\\n\\\\section{The Transaction Operator $TA(M,\\\\ASM{TaCtl}$)}\\n\\\\label{sect:TAoperator}\\n\\nAs explained above, a transaction controller performs the lock\\nhandling, the deadlock detection and handling, the recovery mechanism\\n(for partial recovery) and the commit of single machines. Thus we\\ndefine it as consisting of four components specified in\\nSect.~\\\\ref{sect:TaCtl}\\n\\nSummarize the preceding context in 7 sentences.

       " \"We have an announcement for our backers (and potential backers!) regarding Lobodestroyo on the Wii-U.\\n\\nFirstly please let me explain our initial logic on the original stretch goals. The costs for developing on the next-gen platforms is nice and low. Sony and Microsoft are making rather respectable grabs at the indie market and are trying to make development of titles as easy and appealing to guys like us. With Xbox Ones acting as dev kits (much like the Ouya) for example, the cost is already significantly lower. It was due to these lower anticipated costs that we put the PS4 and Xbox One goals before the Wii-U. 'Put the cheaper targets first so they are easier to obtain'... Pretty simple logic, and something that made sense to all of us on the team. No favoritism. No politics. Just the desire to get Lobo out there on as many consoles as possible after launch.\\n\\nLobo’s roots and inspirations are clearly and unabashedly plucked from the memories of our N64 days. So it makes sense that the Nintendo fans would be attracted to the project. We didn’t realize how much support we’d encounter on any stretch goal system, but the people have spoken and the answer is a resounding vote for the Wii-U.\\n\\nIt is with that said I am happy to let you know that we are restructuring our stretch goals and making Wii-U development our number one priory. Please visit the main page to see the updated stretch goals. We hope that this effort will ease the minds of many of you backing with the expressed goal of getting this game on Nintendo’s console.\\n\\nHow does this effect the launch platforms?\\n\\nSimply put; it doesn’t. We are relying on a matched fund donation from Ouya’s Free the Game Fund to make this game happen. We have budgeted and planned around this in order to keep our initial goal so low. (The asking price is very much the bare-bones cost for us to be able to make the game. We are all working on this project for free).\\n\\nThe Free The Games Fund is an AMAZING opportunity for us to double our funds, and we are extremely appreciative of the people at Ouya for accepting us into their program. Plain and simple we cannot make this game without their support on ANY system. Per our agreement with Ouya there will be a console exclusivity for Lobodestroyo at launch. We are allowed to launch on PC, Mac and Linux formats as well, however we are prohibited from any other console for a period of 1 month per $10,000 matched\\n\\nSummarize the preceding context in 8 sentences.

       " \"\\\\section{Details of some of the derivations}\\n\\nThe derivations given in the paper are quite  self-complete. However, here we give more details of some of the essential equations in the paper in order to help the readers. \\n\\n\\\\begin{enumerate}\\n\\n\\\\item Using  \\\\eqref{10a} and \\\\eqref{11} in the paper,  \\\\eqref{12} follows in a straightforward manner. Here is a detailed derivation of it. We note that\\n\\n\\\\begin{align}\\nO x^{-s} & =  \\\\sum_{n=1}^{\\\\infty}(-1)^{n+1}\\\\exp((\\\\ln n)x\\\\frac{d}{dx})\\\\, x^{-s}\\\\nonumber \\\\\\\\\\n& = \\\\sum_{n=1}^{\\\\infty}(-1)^{n+1}\\\\sum_{m=0}^{\\\\infty}\\\\frac{1}{m!} (\\\\ln n)^{m} \\\\left(x\\\\frac{d}{dx}\\\\right)^{m} x^{-s}\\\\notag\\\\\\\\\\n& = \\\\sum_{n=1}^{\\\\infty} (-1)^{n+1} \\\\sum_{m=0}^{\\\\infty} \\\\frac{(\\\\ln n)^{m} (-s)^{m}}{m!}\\\\notag\\\\\\\\\\n& = \\\\sum_{n=1}^{\\\\infty} (-1)^{n+1} \\\\exp\\\\left(-s\\\\ln n\\\\right) x^{-s} = \\\\sum_{n=1}^{\\\\infty}\\\\frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n^{s}} x^{-s}\\\\notag\\\\\\\\\\n& = (1-2^{1-s})\\\\zeta(s) x^{-s},\\\\quad {\\\\rm Re}\\\\, s>0.\\\\label{app1}\\n\\\\end{align}\\nwhere in the last line, we have used the definition of the Riemann zeta function given in  \\\\eqref{2} of the paper. In the same manner, it can be shown that\\n\\\\begin{align}\\nO^{\\\\dagger} x^{-s} & = \\\\sum_{n=1}^{\\\\infty}\\\\frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n}\\\\exp((\\\\ln n^{-1})x\\\\frac{d}{dx}) x^{-s}\\\\nonumber \\\\\\\\\\n& = \\\\sum_{n=1}^{\\\\infty}\\\\frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n}\\\\sum_{m=0}^{\\\\infty}\\\\frac{1}{m!} (\\\\ln n^{-1})^{m} \\\\left(x\\\\frac{d}{dx}\\\\right)^{m} x^{-s}\\\\notag\\\\\\\\\\n& = \\\\sum_{n=1}^{\\\\infty} \\\\frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n} \\\\sum_{m=0}^{\\\\infty} \\\\frac{(\\\\ln n^{-1})^{m} (-s)^{m}}{m!} x^{-s}\\\\notag\\\\\\\\\\n& = \\\\sum_{n=1}^{\\\\infty} \\\\frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n} \\\\exp\\\\left(-s\\\\ln n^{-1}\\\\right) x^{-s}\\\\notag\\\\\\\\\\n& = \\\\sum_{n=1}^{\\\\infty}\\\\frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n^{1-s}} x^{-s}\\\\notag\\\\\\\\\\n& = (1-2^{s})\\\\zeta(1-s) x^{-s},\\\\quad {\\\\rm Re}\\\\, s <1.\\\\label{app2}\\n\\\\end{align}\\n\\n\\\\item Derivation of Eq. \\\\eqref{15} in the paper: Recall that \\\\eqref{app1} and \\\\eqref{app2} above hold also for $|x|^{-s} = |x|^{-\\\\sigma + i\\\\rho}$, as mentioned in the paper, in the strip $0< {\\\\rm Re}\\\\, s = \\\\sigma <1$. Therefore, using \\\\eqref{app1} and \\\\eqref{app2} above, we obtain\\n\\n\\\\begin{align}\\n\\\\lefteqn{A(\\\\omega)|x|^{-\\\\sigma+i\\\\rho}= |x|^{-\\\\frac{i\\\\omega}{2}}O|x|^{-\\\\frac{i\\\\omega}{2}}|x|^{-\\\\sigma+i\\\\rho}}\\\\nonumber \\\\\\\\\\n& = |x|^{-\\\\frac{i\\\\omega}{2}} O|x|^{-\\\\sigma+i(\\\\rho-\\\\frac{\\\\omega}{2})}\\\\nonumber \\\\\\\\\\n& = (1-2^{1-\\\\sigma+i(\\\\rho-\\\\frac{\\\\omega}{2})})\\\\zeta (\\\\sigma-i(\\\\rho-\\\\frac{\\\\omega}{2}))|x|^{-\\\\sigma+i(\\\\rho-\\\\omega)},\\\\label{app3}\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\lefteqn{A^{\\\\dagger}(\\\\omega)|x|^{-\\\\sigma+i\\\\rho}=  |x|^{\\\\frac{i\\\\omega}{2}}O^{\\\\dagger} |x|^{\\\\frac{i\\\\omega}{2}}|x|^{-\\\\sigma+i\\\\rho}}\\\\nonumber \\\\\\\\\\n& = |x|^{\\\\frac{i\\\\omega}{2}}O^{\\\\dagger}|x|^{-\\\\sigma+i(\\\\rho+\\\\frac{\\\\omega}{2})}\\\\nonumber \\\\\\\\\\n& = (1-2^{\\\\sigma-i(\\\\rho+\\\\frac{\\\\omega}{2})})\\\\zeta (1-\\\\sigma+i(\\\\rho+\\\\frac{\\\\omega}{2}))|x|^{-\\\\sigma+i(\\\\rho+\\\\omega)}.\\\\label{app4}\\n\\\\end{align}\\nIn deriving \\\\eqref{app3} and \\\\eqref{app4},  we have used our earlier results derived in \\\\eqref{app1} and \\\\eqref{app2}.\\n\\n\\\\item Derivation of \\\\eqref{16} in the paper: This basically follows from \\\\eqref{app3} and \\\\eqref{app4} derived above. Note that $A(\\\\omega)$ lowers the imaginary part of the power of $|x|$ by $\\\\omega$ while $A^{\\\\dagger}(\\\\omega)$ raises the imaginary part of the power by $\\\\omega$ (besides giving some multiplicative constants in the function)\\n\\nWe now see how $H_{-}$ operates on $|x|^{-\\\\sigma+i\\\\rho}$, \\n\\\\begin{align}\\n\\\\lefteqn{H_{-}|x|^{-\\\\sigma+i\\\\rho}  = A^{\\\\dagger}(\\\\omega)A(\\\\omega) |x|^{-\\\\sigma+i\\\\rho}}\\\\notag\\\\\\\\\\n& = (1-2^{1-\\\\sigma+i(\\\\rho-\\\\frac{\\\\omega}{2})})\\\\zeta (\\\\sigma-i(\\\\rho-\\\\frac{\\\\omega}{2})) \\\\notag\\\\\\\\\\n& \\\\qquad \\\\times A^{\\\\dagger}(\\\\omega)|x|^{-\\\\sigma+i(\\\\rho-\\\\omega)}\\\\notag\\\\\\\\\\n& = (1-2^{\\\\sigma-i(\\\\rho -\\\\frac{\\\\omega}{2})})(1-2^{1-\\\\sigma+i(\\\\rho-\\\\frac{\\\\omega}{2}})\\\\notag\\\\\\\\\\n&\\\\qquad \\\\times \\\\zeta(\\\\sigma - i(\\\\rho-\\\\frac{\\\\omega}{2}))\\\\zeta(1-\\\\sigma + i(\\\\rho-\\\\frac{\\\\omega}{2}))|x|^{-\\\\sigma+i\\\\rho}.\\\\label{app5}\\n\\\\end{align}\\nIn exactly the same manner, we obtain\\n\\\\begin{align}\\n\\\\lefteqn{H_{+}|x|^{-\\\\sigma+i\\\\rho} = A(\\\\omega)A^{\\\\dagger}(\\\\omega) |x|^{-\\\\sigma+i\\\\rho}}\\\\notag\\\\\\\\\\n& = (1-2^{\\\\sigma-i(\\\\rho+\\\\frac{\\\\omega}{2})})\\\\zeta (1-\\\\sigma+i(\\\\rho+\\\\frac{\\\\omega}{2}))\\\\notag\\\\\\\\\\n&\\\\qquad \\\\times A(\\\\omega) |x|^{-\\\\sigma+i(\\\\rho+\\\\omega)}\\\\notag\\\\\\\\\\n& = (1-2^{\\\\sigma-i\\\\left(\\\\rho+\\\\frac{\\\\omega}{2}\\\\right)})(1-2^{1-\\\\sigma+i\\\\left(\\\\rho+\\\\frac{\\\\omega}{2}\\\\right)})\\\\notag\\\\\\\\\\n&\\\\qquad\\\\times \\\\zeta(\\\\sigma-i(\\\\rho+\\\\frac{\\\\omega}{2}))\\\\zeta(1-\\\\sigma+i(\\\\rho+\\\\frac{\\\\omega}{2}))|x|^{-\\\\sigma+i\\\\rho}.\\\\label{app6}\\n\\\\end{align}\\n\\n\\\\item Explaining \\\\eqref{19a} in the paper: A Hamiltonian (or any other operator) is self-adjoint on a space of functions if it satisfies the condition\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\langle Hg|f\\\\rangle = \\\\langle g|Hf\\\\rangle,\\n$$\\nwhere $|f\\\\rangle, |g\\\\rangle$ are two states in the Hilbert space. In our case, in \\\\eqref{19a}, the states $|\\\\psi_{\\\\rho}\\\\rangle , |\\\\psi_{\\\\rho'}\\\\rangle$ correspond to the state functions\\n\\n\\\\begin{align*}\\n\\\\psi_{\\\\rho}(x) & = \\\\langle x|\\\\psi_{\\\\rho}\\\\rangle = |x|^{-\\\\sigma+i\\\\rho},\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\psi_{\\\\rho'}(x) & = \\\\langle x|\\\\psi_{\\\\rho'}\\\\rangle = |x|^{-\\\\sigma+i\\\\rho'}.\\n\\\\end{align*}\\nTherefore, Eq. (23) which actually follows from \\\\eqref{app5} above, simply says that\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\langle H_{-}\\\\psi_{\\\\rho}|\\\\psi_{\\\\rho'}\\\\rangle \\\\neq \\\\langle\\\\psi_{\\\\rho}|H_{-}\\\\psi_{\\\\rho'}\\\\rangle.\\n$$\\nunless $\\\\sigma=\\\\frac{1}{2}$ and, consequently, it is not self-adjoint otherwise. This is reflected in the fact that the energy eigenvalues in \\\\eqref{app5} are complex if $\\\\sigma\\\\neq \\\\frac{1}{2}$. The same conclusion follows for $H_{+}$ as well.\\n\\n\\\\item Higher states of the system: As we have emphasized $A^{\\\\dagger}(\\\\omega)$ acting on a function $|x|^{-\\\\sigma+i\\\\rho}$ raises the imaginary part of the exponent of $|x|$ by $\\\\omega$ and gives a multiplicative factor as given in \\\\eqref{app4} above. Since the ground state of $H_{-}$ has the form $|x|^{-\\\\frac{1}{2} +i(\\\\frac{\\\\omega}{2}-\\\\lambda_{*})}$, by repeated application of the raising operator $n$ times, we obtain the $n$th higher state of $H_{-}$ to be\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\psi_{n}(x) = (A^{\\\\dagger}(\\\\omega))^{n} \\\\psi_{0}(x) = C_{n} |x|^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}+i(n\\\\omega + (\\\\frac{\\\\omega}{2}-\\\\lambda_{*}))}.\\n$$\\nThe supersymmetric partner state (eigenstate of $H_{+}$) is obtained by applying the lowering operator\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\tilde{\\\\psi}_{n} (x) = A(\\\\omega) \\\\psi_{n}(x).\\n$$\\nSince the lowering operator lowers the imaginary part of the exponent of $|x|$ by $\\\\omega$ (and gives some multiplicative constant as shown in \\\\eqref{app3} above), we obtain\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\tilde{\\\\psi}_{n}(x) = \\\\tilde{C}_{n} |x|^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}+i(n\\\\omega-(\\\\frac{\\\\omega}{2}+\\\\lambda_{*}))},\\n$$\\nwhere $C_{n}, \\\\tilde{C}_{n}$ are multiplicative constants given in \\\\eqref{24} of the paper\\n\\nSummarize the preceding context in 8 sentences.

While users threatened that \"this is just the beginning,\" media groups immediately started producing material celebrating the events. One picture within a series made by pro-IS media group al-Samood stated: \" \\'O French: Same as you kill you are killed and we have promised you of that we will move the battles to your own homes, and then you may taste our severity.\\' \"\\n\\nIn the hours after the attack, security experts told NPR and other news outlets that they suspected al-Qaida would emerge as the group behind the violence, noting the operational expertise it required. But while agreeing with that point, a Dutch fighter with an al-Qaida affiliate says (in a tweet highlighted by SITE) that the targets — civilian instead of military or political — also imply an ISIS role\\n\\nSummarize the preceding context in 5 sentences.
